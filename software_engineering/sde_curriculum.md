What is a Data Engineer?

A data engineer is responsible for building and maintaining the data architecture of a data science project. These engineers have to ensure that there is uninterrupted flow of data between servers and applications. Some of the responsibilities of a data engineer include improving data foundational procedures, integrating new data management technologies and softwares into the existing system, building data collection pipelines, among various other things.

One of the most sought-after skills in data engineering is the ability to design and build data warehouses. This is where all the raw data is collected, stored and retrieved from. Without data warehouses, all the tasks that a data scientist does will become either too expensive or too large to scale.

ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) are the steps which a data engineer follows to build the data pipelines. ETL is essentially a blueprint for how the collected raw data is processed and transformed into data ready for analysis.

Data engineers usually come from engineering backgrounds. Unlike data scientists, there is not much academic or scientific understanding required for this role. Developers or engineers who are interested in building large scale structures and architectures are ideally suited to thrive in this role.

Differences between a Data Scientist and a Data Engineer

- Data Scientists build models using a combination of statistics, mathematics, machine
  learning and domain based knowledge. They are required to code and build these models
  using the same tools/languages and framework that the organization supports.
  
- Data engineers build and maintain the data structures and architectures for data 
  ingestion, processing, and deployment for large-scale data-intensive applications. To 
  build a pipeline for data collection and storage, to funnel the data to the data 
  scientists, to put the model into production -- these are just some of the tasks a data 
  engineer performs.
  
- Data Scientists and Data Engineers must work hand-in-hand in order to ensure things move smoothly for any large scale data science project.

What is Software Engineering?

Application of the standards and principles of engineering to design, develop, maintain, test and evaluate computer software. A Software Engineer may also be referred to as a computer programmer, software designer, or software developer as the nature of software engineering can require knowledge of programming languages, principles of software design and construction.

Software engineers may also be the programmers who test and perform quality assurance checks on new and developing software to ensure its efficacy and efficiency in its real-world application. Software engineers may also be familiar with theories surrounding software uses, however, working with theories typically may not fall under the job description, as computer scientists are the workers who construct and test theories about programming and operation.

Differences between a Computer Scientist and a Software Engineer

1. Computer Science focuses on the science behind making computers work, while software engineering applies those scientific and mathematical principles to the building, designing and implementation of hardware and software programs.

2. Computer Science is a general pathway to many careers ranging from IT support roles, web design, and game development. Software engineering on the other hand is a more narrow field focused on developing and building applications and software programs across business, government, and the game industry.

3. Computer scientists may be responsible for maintaining company security networks, data systems or other computing systems that the business relies upon. Software engineers focus on the development and design of specific software programs that an organization requires to operate.

4. Computer science may deal with the interaction between software and hardware, while software engineers focus only on the software and its production.

5. Computer scientists approach software design by applying theory and algorithms. A software engineer may use this same information if provided but works from the requirements to design the framework and build the program.

6. Computer scientists focus on computing and calculating the best ways to program software as well as finding calculations that allow engineers and developers to build software to meet requirements. Software engineers use these analyses to aid in the full development and construction of new frameworks and software programs.

7. Computer scientists study aspects of mathematical engineering as it applies to computers and computing systems, but it Software Engineers focus on applying real-world engineering concepts to software development.

8. Computer scientists develop the scientific theories underlying computer operations, while software engineers apply these theories to build real-world applications and frameworks.

9. Computer science focuses on the complexity and algorithms within software programs as well as other analytics such as the computational science of programming, structures of visuals and graphics and user interaction. Software engineers take a product management approach which includes the design process, application, evaluation, automated testing and quality assurance checks.

10. Computer science focuses its use of computer coding on the understanding of computer language theory and the use of coding to calculate the compatibility between hardware and software applications. Software engineers apply the results of language theory to engineer new languages and tools and utilizes software languages to develop new applications and frameworks.

One may select software engineering as a degree program and career if the following is true:

* If you prefer a hands-on and real-world application approach to software development
* You are interested in working with the creation and assessment of software development
