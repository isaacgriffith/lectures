# A Bit more About Me as a Person/Instructor

::: columns
:::: {.column width=30%}

**I have been told**

* I come off as condescending
* I come off as rude
* I come off as angry
* I don't take criticism well

**How to deal with this**

* I am a confrontational and forceful speaker, in class
* If you are having a problem with me, please do not hesitate to speak with me individually either after class, via email, or in my office hours so that we can address and resolve the issue.
* I am very dedicated to being the best instructor I can, but without your help I cannot improve myself or my courses.
