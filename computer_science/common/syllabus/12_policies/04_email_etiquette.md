## Email Etiquette {-}

Email is the best possible method of reaching me outside of my office hours. Note that I have certain expectations for communicating with me via email, as follows:

* DO NOT use chat or SMS shorthand in your messages.
* Use full words, and full sentences.
* Maintain the frame of mind that your are communicating to a professional, and that a professional demeanor is required.

Failure to abide by these requirements will result in your email being deleted and forgotten.
