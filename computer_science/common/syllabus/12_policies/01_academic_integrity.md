## Academic Integrity {-}

**Academic Integrity** is expected at Idaho State University and the College of Science and Engineering. All forms of academic dishonesty, including cheating and plagiarism, are strictly prohibited, the penalties for which range up to permanent expulsion from the university with "Expulsion for Academic Dishonesty" noted on the student's transcript.

Academic Integrity violations are a scourge at any University. I detest them with a passion. Anyone found to be violating the academic integrity code on any assignment or exam will be dealt with with extreme prejudice. The standard remedy, in this course, **for any Academic Integrity Violation will be FAILURE of the course**. Please note that in accordance with the Policy at Idaho State University that attempts to withdraw from the course to avoid such punishment will work to no avail.

Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to:

1. Cheating on Exams
2. Plagiarism
3. Collusion
4. Sharing solutions or code on programming assignments

### Definitions {-}

**Cheating** on an examination include:

* Copying from another's exam, any means of communication with another during an exam, giving aid to or receiving aid from another during an exam;
* Using any material during an examination that is unauthorized by the proctor;
* Taking or attempting to take an exam for another student or allowing another student to take or attempt to take an exam for oneself
* Using, obtaining, or attempting to obtain by any means the whole or any part of an administered exam.
* Talking to anyone other than the professor during an exam.

**Plagiarism** is the unacknowledged incorporation of another student's work into work which the student offers for credit.

* The use of the source code of another person's program, even temporarily, is considered plagiarism. This includes attempting to hide the plagiarism by changing variable names, method names, or class names.
* Copying material from another project (including open source projects) without attributing (citing) that project.

**Collusion** is the unauthorized collaboration of another in preparing work that a student offers for credit.
