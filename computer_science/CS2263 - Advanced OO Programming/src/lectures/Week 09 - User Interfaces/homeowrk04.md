# The System

A small university would like to create a registration system for its students. The students will use this system to obtain information about courses, when and where the classes meet, register for classes, print transcripts, drop classes, etc. The faculty will be using this system to find out what classes they are assigned to teach, when and where these classes meet, get a list of students registered for each class, and assign grades to students in their classes. The university administrative staff will be using this database to add new faculty and students, remove faculty and students who have left, put in and update information about each course the university offers, enter the schedules for classes that are being offered in each term, and any other housekeeping tasks that need to be performed.

In finding the classes for this system, one of the issues that comes up is that of distinguishing a course from an offering of the course. For instance "CS 430: Principles of Object-Oriented Software Construction" is a course listed in the university's course catalog. The course is offered once during the fall term and once during the spring term. Each offering may be taught at a different time and place, and in all likelihood will have a different set of students. Therefore, all offerings have some information in common and some information that is unique to that offering. How will you choose a set of classes that models all these interactions?

# Part 01 - System Analysis

You are tasked to analyze the system, extract and list the details of the various business processes, develop the use cases and find the conceptual classes and their relationships.

* For each business process you will need to create a use case
* You will need to combine all the use cases into a single use case diagram
* You will then need to construct a conceptual class diagram

**Note: Be sure to check that your diagrams are 100% correct UML syntax**

# Part 02 - System Design

* For each use case identified in Part 01, construct a UML Sequence Diagram for the use case
* Using these sequence diagrams create a second implementation ready class diagram.

**Note: Be sure to check that your diagrams are 100% correct UML syntax**

# Part 03 - Design Revision

* Review your designs and look for any violations of design principles. If any are found create a new diagram and make the appropriate changes
* During this review also consider whether any design patterns apply. If so, revise your design to include the application of these patterns.

**Note: Be sure to check that your diagrams are 100% correct UML syntax**
