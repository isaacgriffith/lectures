# What?!?

\small But Professor, that's way more jobs than there are team members...

# Team Dynamics

* \small A key to a great team project, is a great team

\vskip.5em

* \small Yet, these things don't happen by accident

\vskip.5em

* \small Typically, when forging a team or adding new members we look at how they interact with current team members
  - \footnotesize Normally a part of the interview process

\vskip.5em

* \small Unfortunately, that is not going to be the case here

# Team Dynamics

* \small Your teams will start out as a random group of students

\vskip.5em

* \small It should be your goal to:
  1. \footnotesize Get to know each other personally (if you don't already), in a setting outside of class
  2. \footnotesize Get to know each other's strengths (technically)
  3. \footnotesize Get to know each other's weaknesses (technically)
  4. \footnotesize Start to create a "\textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Jelled}}" team

# Creating a "Jelled" Team

* \small A team of people so strongly knit that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts

\vskip1em

* \small Characteristics of a jelled team:

  * \footnotesize Very low turnover rate
  * \footnotesize Strong sense of identity
  * \footnotesize A feeling of eliteness
  * \footnotesize Team vs. individual ownership of the project
  * \footnotesize Team members enjoy their work

# Motivating People

* \small Motivation is the greatest influence on performance

\vskip.5em

* \small Monetary rewards usually do not motivate

\vskip.5em

* \small Suggested motivating techniques:

  * \footnotesize 20% time rule
  * \footnotesize Peer-to-peer recognition awards
  * \footnotesize Team ownership (refer to the team as "we")
  * \footnotesize Allow members to focus on what interests them
  * \footnotesize Utilize equitable compensation
  * \footnotesize Encourage group ownership
  * \footnotesize Provide for autonomy, but trust the team to deliver

# Handling Conflict

* \small Preventing or mitigating conflict:

  * \footnotesize Cohesiveness has the greatest effect
  * \footnotesize Clearly defining roles and holding team members accountable
  * \footnotesize Establish work & communications rules in the project charter

\vskip1em

* \small Additional techniques:

  * \footnotesize Clearly define plans for the project
  * \footnotesize Make sure the team understands the importance of the project
  * \footnotesize Develop detailed operating procedures
  * \footnotesize Develop a project charter
  * \footnotesize Develop a schedule of commitments in advance
  * \footnotesize Forecast other priorities and their impact on the project

# Other Difficulties

* \small This project will require time and planning

\vskip.5em

* \small It will also require that you and your team work together to ensure the work is done and is of high quality

\vskip.5em

* \small This means that as a team you need to:
  - \footnotesize Hold regularly scheduled meetings
  - \footnotesize Assign jobs to one another, and hold each other accountable for those assignments
  - \footnotesize Utilize technologies such as Zoom, Slack or Discord, and GitHub to coordinate your project

# Project Grading

* \footnotesize The project is divided into 5 Parts
  - \scriptsize Week 06: Part 1 - Team Formation (5%)
  - \scriptsize Weeks 07 - 08: Part 2 - Planning and Specification (20%)
  - \scriptsize Weeks 09 - 10: Part 3 - Design and Initial Implementation (20%)
  - \scriptsize Weeks 11 - 12: Part 4 - Implementation and Test (20%)
  - \scriptsize Weeks 13 - 14: Part 5 - Release and Deploy (20%)
  - \scriptsize Week 15: Part 6 - Project Presentation (10%)
  - \scriptsize Team Reviews (5%)

\vskip.5em

* \footnotesize The team will receive a grade value, but the individual score for each team member will be weighted by a multiplier.
  - \scriptsize This multiplier will be derived from the feedback reports submitted after each part
  - \scriptsize Thus, as a team you may have done well, but individually you can still fail.
  - \scriptsize This acts a means to ensure accountability of each team member to the team.

# Design Principles

* \small This lecture is a collection of design principles for making better software.

\vskip.5em

* \small Every great programmer has a toolbox of design principles they use to help them produce great code

\vskip.5em

* \small Yes, these principles are admittedly fuzzy and not mutually exclusive

\vskip.5em

* \small They must be learned by specific coding examples/experiences

# The Principles at a Glance

* \small SOLID Principles
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{SRP}} - Single Responsibility Principle
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{OCP}} - Open-Closed Principle
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{LSP}} - Liskov Substitution Principle
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{ISP}} - Interface Segregation Principle
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{DIP}} - Dependency Inversion Principle

\vskip.5em

* \small Others
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{DRY}} - Don't Repeat Yourself
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{LC}} - Loose Coupling
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{HC}} - High Cohesion
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{EV}} - Encapsulate What Varies
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{SoC}} - Separation of Concerns

# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

\textcolor{Buttons}{\textbf{\textit{Classes should not have more than one focus of responsibility}}}

* \small Classes can reasonably be involved in different interactions, it is the *focus* that is the issue.

\vskip.5em

* \small This principle is similar to the cohesion principle and Separation of Concerns (SoC) principle

\vskip.5em

* \small Data-centric designs always violate this principle: the fat class in the middle with all the methods has many different foci.

# SRP Example

* \small A way to figure out if certain methods belong in a given class:
* \small If not, move them to another existing, or new, class

\footnotesize

```ruby
    class Automobile
        def start()
        def stop()
        def changeTires()
        def drive()
        def wash()
        def checkOil()
        def getOil()
    end
```

* \small for each method \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{X}}, ask, "does the \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Automobile}} have primary responsibility for \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{X}}-ing?" If the answer is no, the method doesn't belong.

# SRP Violations

\textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Finding}}

* \small Look for large classes with a lot of methods
  - \footnotesize Inspect these methods to determine if they satisfy the same responsibility
* \small Tend to cause interference between developers on same project
  - \footnotesize Leads to merge conflicts and other problem Areas

\textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Handling}}

* \small If you have a class that violates this principle
  - \footnotesize extract methods belonging to one of the responsibilities into their own class
  - \footnotesize continue doing this until only one responsibility remains
