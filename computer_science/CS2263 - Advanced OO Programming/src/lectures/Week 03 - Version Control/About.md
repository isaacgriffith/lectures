This week begins the student's immersion into the area of Object-Oriented Analysis, Design, Implementation and Refactoring.
We begin with a look at higher-level design principles useful when considering design approaches. Additionally, we begin
our discussion of design patterns which will carry on throughout this course and into CS 3321/INFO 3307.
