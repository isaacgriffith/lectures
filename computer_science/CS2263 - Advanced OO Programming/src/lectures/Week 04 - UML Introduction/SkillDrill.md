# Preliminaries

* We are going to try something a little different this week. Rather than having you all work a small problem set and wasting a large amount of time on what should be a simple task, we will instead work these challenges together.
  - Hopefully this will give you some initial practical experience with these entities
  - and it will give you a bit of guidance on how to solve these problems.

1. Let's create the GitHub repo `elementary-patterns-skilldrill`
2. Next, we will clone this repo on our local machine
3. Next, we will enter the newly created directory and initialize a gradle project

# Design Patterns

## Implement a Quick CLI using a Singleton

## Implement a Stack using a LinkedList Adapter

Often times we are given an API which we need to utilize, but do not have time to fully implement the API. Yet, we most often have an existing component which probably could fit the bill. In this, hopefully quick example, we will implement a Stack using a linked list, following the Adapter Design Pattern.
