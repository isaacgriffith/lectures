# Pair Practicum

* Assuming that you completed the before and after lecture activities, you should have
  a list of 5 facts you know about **Building Software**.

* On the off-chance that you don't have this or it is not available to you today, let's take
  the next few minutes to regenerate it.

  1. At the top of the page write the topic: **Building Software**
  2. Write the numbers 1 - 5 along the left column of the sheet
  3. Brainstorm to identify 5 facts that you know about this topic
     * If you are having a hard time, consult the reading material
     * If you are still having a hard time, use the internet.

# Pair Practicum

Let's take a break for the next 10 minutes and do the following:

1. Everyone stand up, leaving your notes where they are
2. Find a partner from another part of the room
3. There are two roles
   - **Person summarizing** - this person summarizes important concepts covered so far
   - **Person clarifying** - responds by clarifying or adding to the summary
4. Select your roles
5. Consider the following additional questions
   - How do you see this as applicable to your work/life?
   - How important is this information to the issues that this course addresses?
6. Share your facts and thoughts about building software, and identify questions
   you two felt were unanswered by the lecture.
