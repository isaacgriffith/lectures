1. Gradle allows builds to be completely configured, but works with only minimal configuration relying upon assumptions about the project. What is the principle employed here?

   (c) build-by-convention
   (n) build-by-extension
   (n) build via plugins
   (n) none of these choices

2. When configuring repositories for including dependencies in your project, we use "jcenter()".

   (c) False

3. Both implementation and annotationProcessor are built-in configurations used for dependencies in Java projects?
