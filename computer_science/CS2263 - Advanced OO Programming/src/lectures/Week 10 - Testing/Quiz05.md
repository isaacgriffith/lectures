5. True or False. Our starting point for the design phase is the existing conceptual model and a set of requirements specified by use cases.

   (c) True

6. In depicting a call from one object to another, using a sequence diagram, we use a dashed arrow with a small triangular arrow head.

   (c) False

   (c) True

# UI Fundamentals

10. User centered design places the focus of design on the user's point of view in order to ensure that UI/UX solutions serve the users and satisfy the client

    (c) True
