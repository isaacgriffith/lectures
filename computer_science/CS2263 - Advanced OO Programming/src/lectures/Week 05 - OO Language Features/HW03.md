# Git and Setup

Create a new **private** repository on GitHub named "cs2263_hw03", with a README, MIT License, and a .gitignore file for Java.
Clone this repository on you local machine, and then initialize the repository using git flow.

## Basic Documentation Feature

Start a new feature to set up your documentation
Add a Changelog to your project following the guidance from [changelog site]
Structure your readme following the guidance at [...]
Update your gitignore file using the one provided on moodle [...]
Add a `docs` folder to your project, and add in a simple `index.md` file with some basic information regarding this homework.

Add and commit your changes
Finish your feature and push the changes to git

Start a new release called `v0.0.1`
Verify that you have everything needed for this first section (see grading criteria below)
Update your changelog for this release
Update your readme
Once complete add and commit your changes
Finish the release
Push all branches and tags to github

Set up your github pages for your repo to use the "docs" folder

## Gradle and Dependencies Feature

Start a new feature to setup the necessary dependencies for your project

Initialize your repository using gradle to be a Java Application
Next, setup your build.gradle to make the following work correctly
 - Javadoc such that you can generate javadoc into the folder "docs/javadoc" in the root of your project
 - Add in the plugin for license management (so that each code file will have the correct license header)
 - Add in the JavaFX plugin and setup your project to correctly work with JavaFX
 - Add in the Gson dependency so that you can serialize data to JSON as needed.

Once you have complete each of the above tasks, do the following
 - Update your changelog to reflect the changes in this feature (in the unreleased section)
 - Verify that you can generate JavaDoc into your "docs/javadoc" folder
 - add and commit all of your changes
 - Finish the feature and push the changes to your repo

## Now for the Actual Work

Assuming that you have complete the two prior features you should be ready to do the following:
 - Create a JavaFX application
 - Serialize and Deserialize objects using Gson
 - Generate JavaDoc for your project, and be able to show it using GitHub Pages
 - Have a changelog that describes the current state of your project
 - Have a correctly structured README
 - Have a single release
 - Have a well function project that does not include any components from your ide (due to using a good gitignore file)

Now we commence the real work

## First Behavior Feature

Using JavaFX you are to create a small UI application based on the following requirements:

* Start a new feature for this section

0. Before you jump into creating the code for this project, you need to do the following things:
   * Read through the following items and design a class diagram for this project using lucid charts
   * Read through what is expected of the user interface and draw up a simply diagram of what the UI might look like using lucid charts
   * Export both images to either to PNG files and save them to your repository in a new folder called "docs/images"
   * You should then include these images in your GitHub pages documentation of the project, in a section titled "Design"
     - provide a brief description of what these images show

1. Create two classes:
   * `CourseProcessor` which contains the UI interface
   * `Course` which store information about a single course
2. This program will accept and store information about courses offered in six departments: Computer Science, Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, and Electrical Engineering.

3. The user can do the following
   * Enter information about a course by selecting a department name from a combo box (text entry with a drop down list), typing in the course number, name, number of credits and then pressing the enter button. The interface checks that the entries are non-empty (displaying error messages otherwise) and then creates a `Course` object using the information and stores the object in an appropriate data structure.

   * Ask to list all courses by clicking on a button labeled display (all). All the objects in the data structure are displayed. There is a scrollbar that allows viewing records that cannot be displayed in the given space. Also, note the department codes such as CS and MATH are inserted by the program.

   * Ask to list courses of a given department by clicking on a button labeled display (dept.). Courses for the selected department (via the combo box) in the data structure are displayed.

   * Quit instantly by clicking on the window's 'close' button, or close (after a confirmation dialog) via an 'exit' button within the window.

   * Save the current catalog of courses to a JSON file using the save button

   * Load a new catalog of courses from a JSON file using the load button

4. Department codes: The codes associated with departments should be stored in static arrays within the class `Course`. This mapping should not be duplicated and should be used consistently and reliably withing your code. The codes are given below:

+------------------------+----------+
| **Department**         | **Code** |
+:=======================+:========:+
| Computer Science       | CS       |
+------------------------+----------+
| Mathematics            | MATH     |
+------------------------+----------+
| Chemistry              | CHEM     |
+------------------------+----------+
| Physics                | PHYS     |
+------------------------+----------+
| BIOLOGY                | BIOL     |
+------------------------+----------+
| Electrical Engineering | EE       |
+------------------------+----------+

5. Implement your design

6. Once you have finished your implementation
   * Remember to add and commit all of your changes
   * Finish the feature
   * Start a new release called "v0.1.0"
   * Update the changelog to reflect the changes made
   * Update your readme to include information in each section as it pertains to your project
   * Ensure that every class is properly documented
     - All non private methods have proper JavaDoc documentation
     - Each class includes a description comment and your name in the `@author` tag
     - Each source file contains the appropriate license header
   * Ensure that your program runs from both your IDE and the command line
   * Generate the JavaDoc and then link to it from your `docs/index.md` file
   * Add and commit all changes made
   * Finish your release, then push all branches and tags to github

# Submission

* Make your repository public (this can be done in the repository settings section)
* Then submit the URL to your repository for grading.
