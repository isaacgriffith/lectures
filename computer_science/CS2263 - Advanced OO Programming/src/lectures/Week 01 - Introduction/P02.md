* A consumer group tests products. Create a class named `Product` with the following fields:
  - \scriptsize Model name
  - \scriptsize Manufacturer's name
  - \scriptsize Retail price
  - \scriptsize An overall rating ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F')
  - \scriptsize A reliability rating (based on a consumer survey) that is a double value between 0 and 5
  - \scriptsize The number of customers who contributed to the survey on reliability rating

* The class must have two constructors:

  1. \scriptsize Accepts the model name, the manufacturer name, and the retail price in that order
  2. \scriptsize Accepts the model name and the manufacturer name in that order, and this constructor must effectively use the first constructor

* Methods
  - \scriptsize Getters for every field.
  - \scriptsize Setters for retail price and overall rating.
  - \scriptsize `rateReliability` - inputs the reliability rating of a customer.
    * \tiny Has a single parameter that takes in the reliability of the product as viewed by a customer.
    * \tiny Increment the number of customers who rated the product and update the reliability rating using the following formula:

      \vskip.5em
      `New value of reliability rating = (prior reliability rating * prior number of customers + Reliability rating by this customer) / New value of number of customers`
      \vskip.5em

    * \tiny For example, suppose that the old value of reliability was 4.5 based on the input from 100 customers. If a new customer gives a reliability rating of 1.0, then the new value of reliability would be (4.5 * 100 +1.0) / 101 = 4.465347
