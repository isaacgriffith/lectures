# In Class Exercise

**Team Building**

* Form your teams (group together)
* Take the next 10 minutes getting to know one another
  - Names
  - Hobbies/Extra-curricular Activities
  - Hometowns
  - Fun Facts

Finally, figure out when you will have your first team meeting to figure out team roles, tools, and initial ideas.

# Team Roles

Each team will need one of the following

* A Team Leader
* A Person in charge of the Git
* A Person in charge of design (but not solely responsible)
* A Person in charge of development (but not solely responsible)
* A Person in charge of testing (but not solely responsible)
* A Person in charge of deployment (but not solely responsible)
* A Person in charge of UI (but not solely responsible)
* A Person in charge of requirements (but not solely responsible)
* A Person in charge of build (but not solely responsible)
