\Huge Behavior-Driven Development

# Concept

* Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a term used to classify a method to build software by describing the application behavior from the perspective of an what is of value to the stakeholders.

* Other terms associated with the same concept --
  - Agile Acceptance Testing
  - Acceptance Test-Driven Development
  - Example-Driven Development
  - Code By Example
  - Story Testing
  - Story Test-Driven Development
  - Specification by Example

# Definition

> "Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a second-generation, outside-in, pull-based, multi-stakeholder, multiple-scale, high-automation, agile methodology.

\vskip1em

> It describes a cycle of interactions with well defined outputs, resulting in the delivery of working, tested software" -- Dan North (Creator of BDD)

# BDD Principles

* Just Enough
* Deliver stakeholder value
* Behavior only

# User Story Example

* **Title**: Register customers for VIP program

  **In order to** be able to do direct marketing of products to existing customers,

  **a** marketing manager

  **wants** customers to register personal details by joining a VIP program.

* **Title**: Free delivery for VIP customers

  **In order to** entice existing customers to register for the VIP program,

  **a** marketing manager

  **wants** the system to offer free delivery on certain items to VIP customers

# Scenario Template

**Title** [title of the scenario]

**Given** [some initial context / system State]

**And** [more context / system State]

**When** [ an event occurs / user Action occurs]

**Then** [ensure outcome / system Reaction]

**And** [some outcomes / system Reactions]

# User Story & Scenario Example

* **Title**: Customer withdraws cash

  **In order to** not want to wait in line at the bank,

  **a** customer

  **wants** to withdraw cash from the bank ATM

* **Title**: Account is overdrawn past the overdraft limit

  **Given** the account is overdrawn

  **And** the card is valid

  **When** the customer request for cash withdrawal

  **Then** ensure a rejection message is displayed

  **And** ensure the cash is not dispensed

  **And** ensure the card is returned

# BDD Characteristics

* Ubiquitous Language
* Iterative Decomposition Process
* Plain text description using Story and Scenarios templates
* Automated Acceptance Testing with Mapping Rules
* Readable Behavior Oriented Specification & code
* Behavior Driven at different levels

# BDD Tools

* JBehave, NBehave
* RSpec, MSpec, Spock
* StoryQ, Cucumber, SpecFlow

# BDD Anti-Patterns

* BDD is a framework with keywords & flavors
* BDD is for defining system behavior and TDD for lower level components
* BDD is for business applications and TDD is for API libraries
* BDD is too explicit, verbose.
* BDD is for higher level, TDD is for lower level
* BDD is for integration testing, TDD is for unit testing
* BDD is outside-in, TDD is inside-out


# Acceptance testing

* Acceptance tests are roughly tests corresponding to use-cases: one per use-case.
* They should test the customer-facing side of the app: is it "acceptable" to customers?

# Behavior-Driven Development

BDD is a relatively new approach to acceptance testing

* BDD-style acceptance tests start off in a format similar to a use-case scenario (a story): a linear sequence of steps in English.
* A precise mapping of that English on to code is defined.
* So, its "just acceptance tests" but you don't have to stare at a pile of code to decipher the test.
* BDD slowly is gaining acceptance and may be mainstream eventually

# Integration Testing

* Integration tests are similar to acceptance tests - they also test the whole system
* But, integration tests are low-level things about whole system, not customer-facing
* If we were testing the front-end by automatically clicking on buttons that would be an acceptance test: "is the whole app performing acceptably?"

# CI Services for testing

* One challenge of CI is individual developers have different build setups on their laptops
* A relatively recent solution is to use a CI service to run your build on a blank box and then run all your tests.
* The CI service defines the "gold standard" of success or fail of tests.
* The CI service requires a fully automated build and test process as a prerequisite
  - you should have this anyway; putting a CI service in the loop forces this

# CI Services for testing

* Why Github and Travis together? For every push to master, Travis gets notified and builds project and runs your test suite!
* Jenkins is a service similar to Travis which you must run yourself on your own computer.
* CI servers can also deploy for you, e.g. to Heroku.
* Its harder to test front-ends on CI servers and we don't require that for your projects.

# Testing UIs

* Its hard to automate the input aspects of forms, scrollbars, etc.
* But things keep improving in terms of tools, and eventually it should be commonplace.
* Android -- see Android UI testing best practices for more details.
* JavaScript Web front-ends -- see e.g. TestCafe for programmatic testing of JavaScript web front-ends.
* Unit tests are for one component only; how to deal with missing components you may be interacting with? Mock them up; see e.g. mockito for a framework to help with Java mocking, etc.
