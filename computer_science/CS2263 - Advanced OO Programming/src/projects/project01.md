# Project

## Description

You are to build a simple ToDo List app using JavaFX. The goal of this project is to put into practice several of the techniques discussed in lecture.

## Minimally Required Features

* The app must be capable of tracking multiple todo lists (i.e., shopping, work, personal, etc). The User should have the ability to name these lists to whatever name they so choose.
* Each list can be empty or have an unspecified number of items (there is no limit).
* Each item in the list should have a title, a description, a priority, and a possible date and time by which it is due.
* Items can be added or removed from the list at anytime.
* Items go through a lifecycle, when initially created they are immediately added to the currently viewed list and enter the "Created" state, if their due date passes then they enter the "Overdue" state, and if they are completed they move to the archived list and enter the "Completed" state.
* Users can also move items from one list to another.
* The program should save the state of the list to a file anytime there is a change. The list must be stored in either JSON or YAML format.

## Part 01

* You will need to create your project GitHub repository
* You will need to initialize the repo to use GitFlow
* You will need to initialize the repo to use Gradle
* You will need to add a ChangeLog and a README with the proper formatting
