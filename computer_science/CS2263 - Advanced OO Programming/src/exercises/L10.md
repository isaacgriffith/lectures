# In Class Exercise 01

Get into groups

Consider the following specs:

You have been asked to build a new Campus Security System, based on our Campus Security Data Object, which tracks current threat alerts (weather, national threat level, and campus threats).  We need you to create an initial application that provides three displays:  weather conditions, national threat color level, campus threat instructions, all updated real time as the Campus Security Data Object receives the most recent alerts.

Also, this needs to be an expandable Security System.  We want to release an API so other schools can write their own threat displays and plug them right in.  Weï¿½d like you to supply that API.

The Campus Security Data class is as follows:

Campus Security

* getWeatherData()
* getNationalAlert()
* getCampusAlert()
* alertsChanged()

// other methods

Your job is to implement the alertsChanged() method so that it updates the three displays for: weather conditions, national threat color level, and campus threat instructions every time the Campus Security Data Object gets new alert data.

Using the Observer Pattern, draw the class diagram for the Campus Security System, including the Campus Security Data Object and its display elements.  Be sure to show all relationships.

# In Class Exercise 02

Compare the PULL vs PUSH style of update.  How are they implemented differently?  Why do we need both options?
