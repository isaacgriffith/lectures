# In Class Exercise 01

In lecture, we discussed a number of software principles, including Encapsulate What Varies, DRY, LSP, OCP, ISP, and SRP. Identify in each of the following cases which if any of these principles are violated and if so, (a) justify your reasoning as to why that principle applies in a sentence or two, and (b) outline how the code can be corrected (words is fine for the latter if it is clear, or you can give revised code).

Note, there may be more than one principle violated. In the case of more than one, explain each principle; but, don't identify a design principle without very good cause.

This class is a snippet from a console-based 2D board game implementation (think e.g. Chess or Checkers)

```java
class Game {
    private Piece[][] board;
    public void move() {
        /* Read user input */
        Point source = readCoordinateFromInput();
        Point dest = readCoordinateFromInput();
        /* Does the source square have a piece? Is the desination empty? */
        if (board[source.x][source.y] == null || board[dest.x][dest.y] != null)
            throw new IllegalMoveException();
        /* ... More rules here .. */
        /* Print out the current state of the board */
        printBoard();
    }

    private Point readCoordinateFromInput() {
        /* Read input from the terminal and convert to a point */
    }
    private void printBoard() {
        /* Printing code here */
    }
}
```

This code defines an API for interacting with a batch computing cluster.

```java
public interface ClusterManager {
    public int getJobCount();
    public List<JobId> getActiveJobIds();
    public JobId startJob(Job job);
    public double getJobProgress(JobId id);
    public void waitForJobToFinish(JobId id);
    public void pauseJob(JobId id);
    public void resumeJob(JobId id);
    public List<MachineId> getMachineIds();
    public MachineId getMachineIdForJob(JobId id);
    public List<JobId> getJobsOnMachine(MachineId id);
    public double getClusterLoadPercentage();
    public DiagnosticReport runClusterDiagnostics();
    public void restartCluster();
}
```
