# In Class Exercise 01

This is an **in-class group exercise**. Work with some of your near neighbors. Print all names on the top of the page. Submit your papers on the way out. If we have time we will also present some in class.

We are currently designing the *retakes* web app to allow students to schedule re-takes for missed in-class quizzes. We need your help in writing user stories for new functionalities. Use the style illustrated in the readings. Write one user story for each of the following three functionalities:

* Canceling a retake appointment.
* Entering retake dates, times, and locations
* Setting up a new course
