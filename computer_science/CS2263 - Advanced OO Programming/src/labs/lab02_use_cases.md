\begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
\item Just as we were using class diagrams above to understand a real-world domain, use-cases can also be used to describe "IRL" activities. Write a use-case for the process of grabbing food at your regular lunch spot. Or, if you eat at home describe the activity of making your lunch, including some variations of the different choices you make. For example: if its the dorm cafeteria food, you may start off by getting a tray, and there may be several islands such as the salad bar, grill, etc to choose food from, etc. Include at least five steps in your use-case. **Note: This is not a Use-Case Diagram, but rather the Use-Case description which describes a single Use-Case**
