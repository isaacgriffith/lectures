\begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{$\cdot$}]
\item In lecture, we discussed a number of software principles, including Encapsulate What Varies, DRY, LSP, OCP, ISP, and SRP. Identify in each of the following cases which if any of these principles are violated and if so, (a) justify your reasoning as to why that principle applies in a sentence or two, and (b) outline how the code can be corrected (words is fine for the latter if it is clear, or you can give revised code).

\item Note, there may be more than one principle violated. In the case of more than one, explain each principle; but, don't identify a design principle without very good cause.

\item Download the file lab02.zip, which contains a Java project. In this project there are five packages representing the 5 problems. All packages are named "prob0X" and are under the main package "edu.isu.cs2263.lab02". In the code there is a comment which describes what the class or classes are meant to be used for. Use this information and the given code to determine which principles have been violated, and how to fix the code.
