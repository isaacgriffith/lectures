# Project Iteration 5: Alpha Release {-}

This iteration follows the format of the iteration 4 assignment.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{$\cdot$}]
\item You should have your core app working for this iteration.
\item We still expect bugs to occur and for numerous features to be missing.
\item We are beginning to focus on code quality now. Remember all those design principles, patterns, etc? For iterations 5 and 6 a larger focus is on refining your code. We will be looking over your code and giving suggestions for improvement.
\item The only new requirement is that you must also supply a packaged version of your app. This means either an .exe (Windows), .pkg/.dmg (macOS) or package managers in Linux. Talk with your instructor for details.
\item Don't forget to keep up (or improve if lagging) your git workflow, testing, deployment/README, project boards, changelog, etc mentioned in previous iteration assignments.
\end{enumerate}


# Submission {-}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{$\cdot$}]
\item By the due date your team needs to produce a release which is merged into master and tagged as "Iteration 05"
\item This tagged version of your code is what will be evaluated.
\end{enumerate}
