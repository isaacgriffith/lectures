# In-Class Project Overview Presentations {-}

The big picture goal is to get across the ideas of the current state of your project to the audience, which will be members of other groups.

* Give an overview of your project, i.e. the purpose and what the user expects to get out of it; showing GUIs would be helpful here.
* Demo any features that are working. You are encouraged to video the demo and show that - less chance of messing up! We want a live demo at the end though.
* Describe the high-level deployment architecture, in particular any distribution, web interaction, database used, etc.
* Next, present a high-level project code overview, likely via a UML class diagram.
* Describe some of the complex algorithms or protocols you are needing to implement and probably show some actual code.
* Finally briefly describe what the status of your implementation is at this point.

## Logistics for the Overview Presentations {-}

* We are going to divide up into multiple sub-groups so each group will have enough time to present.
* Each sub-group is going to meet in a different room; room announcements will be made on the forum.
* Your project group will have around 15 minutes to present.
* Each room will have an LCD projector to use for the presentation.
* You are a critical member of the presentations both as a presenter and an observer---one of the goals is to get some good discussions going on the different projects, and we hope you learn something from seeing how the other project groups are tackling various problems.

## Overview Presentation Grading {-}

The keys are organization and clarity.

* Show up -- if you are absent on any presentation day (even if your group is not presenting) you will be heavily penalized.
* Have an organized presentation that you ran through in advance, and have different duties divided up amongst group members.
* Nerdy presentations are OK, we are not expecting fancy speeches or cool wardrobes. Just understandable presentations that get us interested in your project.
* In terms of the form of the presentation format, powerpoint or similar slides are a good choice.

## Examples {-}

* Here is an example overview presentation slide deck
* Here is an example final demo presentation slide deck

## Final Demo Presentations {-}

* Give an overview of your project, including goals, architecture, and design. You probably want to have a slide show but it is not required. If you think an interpretive dance will serve better than slides, then by all means go for it.
* Demo your project: show the project works. Be sure your demo is iron-clad, test it in advance in exactly the same environment as the demo.
  - We need a live demo, but you can consider making a video as backup in case things blow up.
* Each room will have an LCD projector to use for the presentation. If you have a phone app you need to run on the phone, please set up mirroring software so we can see your phone on the big screen (iOS/Android info)
* Prepare a review of the most interesting sections of code in advance. You don't need to overview all of the code; do some of the critical, core and unique aspects.
  - Give a very brief review of the project context around each fragment, either by demoing or showing gui sketches, etc, so the code won't be totally out of the blue.
* You will have 20 minutes to present and we will be asking 10 minutes of questions and (which may be interspersed with your presentation) and asking you try to certain inputs in your application.
