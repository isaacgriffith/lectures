CS 4423 - Software Evolution and Program Analysis

An exploration of the theory and issues surrounding the maintenance and improvement of existing software systems. Topics will include the identification and triage of software bugs, patching and deploying fixes to existing software systems, refactoring software in large code bases, and the processes for managing change and maintenance of software systems. The second half of this course will focus on the identification of issues in software using program analysis. Specifically, focusing on current techniques used in static and dynamic analysis of software to identify maintainability, security, and performance issues. The course will culminate in two projects, one being the successful modification and refactoring of a large software system and the second in the development of a basic dynamic analysis tool.
