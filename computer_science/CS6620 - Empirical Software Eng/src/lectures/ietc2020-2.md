# Motivation

* Software systems are increasingly multilingual
* Posing a challenge for the development of analysis tools
* Island Grammars pose a possible solution
* Here we present an approach to normalize grammars for merging

# Research Goal

Prior to merging, a grammar must be constrained such that its contained productions and each production's contained symbols are arranged in a consistent manner equivalent to the original grammar, allowing for unambiguous merging decisions.

\vskip1em

This leads to the following research goal:

* **Research Goal:** Develop an approach to normalize a grammar in such a way that the grammar is equivalent to the original but in a state which reduces the effort to merge grammars by reducing ambiguity in merge decision making.

\Huge Approach

# Normalization Constraints

- All productions must be of the following two forms
  * $Form_1$: A production composed of a rule containing at least one symbol, and where all symbols are concatenated with one another.
    - Ex: $\left< A \right> \rightarrow \left< B \right> \,\,b \,\,\ldots$
  * $Form_2$: A production composed of an alternation of one or more symbols.
    - Ex: $\left< A \right> \rightarrow \left< B \right > | \,b\, | \,\epsilon\, | \ldots$
- A symbol in a rule cannot have the same form as the containing rule
- Unit rules are not permitted
  - Ex: $\left< A \right> \rightarrow a$
- No pair of productions may have identical rhs

**Interpretation**

* The presented results indicate the approach works as designed
* Each normalized grammar met the conditions of normalization
* The large increases in the XML and Java grammars was due to the conversion of ANTLR features to BNF

# Example - Brainfuck

**Before Normalization**

\vskip-.5em
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left<file\right> & \rightarrow & \left<statment\right>* \\
\left<statement\right> & \rightarrow & \left<opcode\right> | \\
& & \left<LPAREN\right> \left<statement\right>* \left<RPAREN\right> \\
\left<opcode\right> & \rightarrow & \left<GT\right> | \left<LT\right> | \left<PLUS\right> | \left<MINUS\right> | \left<DOT\right> | \left<COMMA\right> \\
\left<GT\right> & \rightarrow & > \\
\ldots
\end{eqnarray*}

**After Normalization**

\vskip-.5em
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left<file\right> & \rightarrow & \left<A\right> | \epsilon \\
\left<statement\right> & \rightarrow & > | < | + | - | . | , | \left<B\right> \\
\left<B\right> & \rightarrow & [ \left<file\right> ] \\
\left<A\right> & \rightarrow & \left<statement\right> \left<file\right>
\end{eqnarray*}

# Validity Threats and Future Work

**Threats to Validity**

* **Construct**: Examination of a single normalization method
* **Conclusion**: Study sample was too small
* **Internal & External**: Lack of support for grammars used in practice

**Future Work**

* Refine and combine our approaches into a framework for the development of software analytics tools.
* Expansion of the study into a full experiment
* Combining current work into a full process for automated Island Grammar generation
