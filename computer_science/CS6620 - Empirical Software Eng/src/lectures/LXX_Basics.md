# What Type of Question are you asking?

* Exploratory
* Baserate
* Correlation
* Causal Relationship
* Design

# Exploratory Questions

* Existence:
  - Does X exist?
* Description and Classification
  - What is X like?
  - What are its properties?
  - How can it be categorized?
  - How can we measure it?
  - What are its components?
* Descriptive-Comparative
  - How does X differ from Y?

# Baserate Questions

* Frequency and Distribution
  - How often does X occur?
  - What is an average amount of X?
* Descriptive-Process
  - How does X normally work?
  - By what process does X happen?
  - What are the steps as X evolves?

# Correlation Questions

* Relationship
  - Are X and Y related?
  - Do occurrences of X correlate with occurrences of Y?

# Causal Relationship Questions

* Causality
  - Does X cause Y?
  - Does X prevent Y?
  - What causes X?
  - What effect does X have on Y?
* Causality-Comparative
  - Does X cause more Y than does Z?
  - Is X better at preventing Y than does Z?
  - Does X cause more Y than does Z under one condition but not others?

# Design Questions

* What is an effective way to achieve X?
* How can we improve X?

# Theory

* Our Theories impact how we see the world
  - Real-world phenomena too rich and complex
  - Need a way of filtering our observations
  - The theory guides us, whether it is explicitly stated or not
* In Quantitative Methods:
  - Theoretical lens tells you what variables to measure..
  - ...and which to ignore or control
* In Qualitative Methods:
  - Theoretical lens usually applied after data is collected
  - ...and used to help with labeling and categorizing the data

# Theories are good for generalization...

\begin{center}
\color{Roarange}\textunderline{Statistical Generalization}\color{Black}
\end{center}

* Generalize from sample to population
* Can only be used for quantifiable variables
* Based on random sampling:
  - Test whether results on a sample apply to the whole population
* Not useful when:
  - You can't characterize the population
  - You can't do random sampling
  - You can't get enough data points

::::
:::: column

\begin{center}
\color{Roarange}\textunderline{Analytical Generalization}\color{Black}
\end{center}

* Generalize from findings to theory
* Applicable to quantitative and qualitative studies
* Compares findings with theory
  - Do the data support/refute the theory?
  - Do they support this theory better than rival theories?
* Supports empirical induction:
  - Evidence builds if subsequent studies also support the theory
* More powerful than stats
  - Doesn't rely on correlations
  - Examines underlying mechanisms

# Putting the Question in Context

# Choose a Method...

::: columns
:::: column

* Exploratory
  \color{Roarange}Used to build new theories where we don't have any yet\color{Black}
  - E.g. What do CMM level 3 organizations have in common?
  - E.g. What are the experiences of developers who have adopted Ruby?

* Descriptive
  \color{Roarange}Describes sequence of events and underlying mechanisms\color{Black}
  - E.g. How does pair programming actually work?
  - E.g. How do software immigrants naturalize?

::::
:::: column

* Causal
  \color{Roarange}Determines whether there are causal relationship between phenomena\color{Black}
  - E.g. Does tool X lead to software with fewer defects?
  - E.g. Do requirements traceability tools help programmers find information more rapidly?

* Explanatory
  \color{Roarange}Adjudicates between competing explanations (theories)\color{Black}
  - E.g. Why does software inspection work?
  - E.g. Why do people fail to document their requirements?
