# Introduction

\small What is a Systematic Literature Review?

\pause
\vskip.5em

* \footnotesize  Conducted to "identify, analyze, and interpret all available evidence related to a specific research question"

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \footnotesize  Aims to give a complete, comprehensive, and valid picture of existing evidence

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \footnotesize  This must be done in a scientific and rigorous way, using the following 3-step process:
  1. \scriptsize Planning the review
  2. \scriptsize Conducting the review
  3. \scriptsize Reporting the review

# Planning the Review

\small Planning an SLR requires the following actions:

* \footnotesize  Identification of the need for a review

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \footnotesize  Specifying the review questions

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \footnotesize  Developing a review protocol

# Need for a Review

\small The need for an SLR is typically one or more of the following:

\pause

* \footnotesize  Aiming to understand the state-of-the art in a research area

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \footnotesize  A desire to use empirical evidence in decision-making

\pause

# Review Questions

* \small The area of review and the questions set the focus.

\pause

* \small To develop appropriate questions use the PICO(C) method:
  
  \pause
  
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{P: Population}} - the population in which the evidence is collected, i.e., which group of people, programs or businesses are of interest for the review?
  
  \pause
  
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{I: Intervention}} - the intervention applied in the empirical study, i.e., which technology, tool or procedure is under study?
  
  \pause
  
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{C: Comparison}} - the comparison to which the intervention is compared, i.e. how is the control treatment defined?
  
  \pause
  
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{O: Outcomes}} - the outcomes of the experiment should not only be statistically significant, but also be significant from a practical point of view.
  
  \pause
  
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{C: Context}} - the context of the study must be defined, which is an extended view of the population, including whether it is conducted in academia or industry, in which industry segment, and also the incentives for the subjects.

\pause

* \small Additionally the experiment designs to include should be noted in the research question.

# Population Examples

* \small A specific software engineering role
  - \footnotesize testers, managers

\vskip.5em

* \small A category of software engineer
  - \footnotesize novice or experienced

\vskip.5em

* \small An application area
  - \footnotesize IT systems, command and control systems

\vskip.5em

* \small An industry group
  - \footnotesize Telecomm companies or small IT companies

# PICO Example

\small From Kitchenham et al.

* \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Population:}} software or web project
* \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Intervention:}} cross-company project effort estimation model
* \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Comparison:}} single-company project effort estimation model
* \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Outcomes:}} prediction or estimation accuracy

\small This led to the following questions:

1. \footnotesize What evidence is there that cross-company estimation models are not significantly different from within-company estimation models for predicting effort for software/web projects?

2. \footnotesize What characteristics of the study data sets and the data analysis methods used in the study affect the outcome of within- and cross-company effort estimation accuracy studies?

3. \footnotesize Which experimental procedures is most appropirate for studies comparing within- and cross-company estimation models?

# Exercise

Take out a sheet of paper and for the next 5 minutes identify the PICO structure of your research project:

\vskip.5em

* \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Population?}}

\vskip.5em

* \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Intervention?}}

\vskip.5em

* \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Comparison?}}

\vskip.5em

* \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Outcomes?}}

# Review Protocol

* \small Defines the review procedures and acts as a log

\vskip.5em


* \small The protocol should contain:
  * \footnotesize Background and rationale
  * \footnotesize Research questions
  * \footnotesize Search strategy for primary studies
  * \footnotesize Study selection criteria
  * \footnotesize Study selection procedures
  * \footnotesize Study quality assessment checklists and procedures
  * \footnotesize Data extraction strategy
  * \footnotesize Synthesis of the extracted data
  * \footnotesize Dissemination strategy
  * \footnotesize Project timetable

# Review Protocol

* \small Ensures consistency

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small Ensures validity

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small You should also conduct a pre-study to
  - \footnotesize scope the research questions
  - \footnotesize validate the search strings
  - \footnotesize validate the inclusion/exclusion criteria

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small Be open to modifying questions during protocol development

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small Once finalized, you should review the protocol for validity

# Conducting the Review

\small A review is conducted by executing the following tasks:

1. \footnotesize Identification of research
2. \footnotesize Selection of primary studies
3. \footnotesize Study quality assessment
4. \footnotesize Data extraction and monitoring
5. \footnotesize Data synthesis

# Research Identification

\small This step focuses on the search strategies that will be used to find primary studies, which include:

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \footnotesize Primary Study Identification
  - \scriptsize Manual Search
  - \scriptsize Database Search

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \footnotesize Snowball sampling

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \footnotesize Grey Literature

# Manual Search

* \small Manual search can be conducted in the following locations:
  * \footnotesize Prominent Author's webpages
  * \footnotesize References of existing literature reviews
  * \footnotesize Known Conferences for the research area
  * \footnotesize Known Journals for the research area

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Goal:}} Obtain a representative sample of papers then conduct snowball sampling.
  * \footnotesize The tradeoff between manual and database search is
    - \scriptsize Less false positives up front than with database search
    - \scriptsize Requires more rounds of snowball sampling
    - \scriptsize Underrepresentative samples lead to higher chance of missing key primary studies

# Database Search

\small Use when you do not have enough knowledge to conduct a manual search

* \small The process is as follows:

  1. \footnotesize Develop your search string
  2. \footnotesize Database selection
  3. \footnotesize Search execution

\vskip.5em
\pause

\small Note that there is always a tradeoff between:

* \footnotesize finding all relevant primary studies
* \footnotesize being overwhelmed with false positives to be removed manually
* \footnotesize Thus, we need to calibrate our search string

# Search String

* \small Use the research questions to create sets of keywords

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small You should have one set per item of your PICO(C) question criteria

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small For each item in each set, identify applicable synonyms for each keyword and add to the set.

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small Build a Boolean search string from the selected keywords
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{OR}} together keywords within a set
  - \footnotesize surround sets with parentheses
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{AND}} together the sets
* \small If necessary, refine the expression to improve your results.

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small You should analyze the sensitivity of the results of your search to refine the search string.

# Search String Examples

\footnotesize From Kitchenham et al.

* \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Population:}} software or web project
* \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Intervention:}} cross-company project effort estimation model
* \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Comparison:}} single-company project effort estimation model
* \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Outcomes:}} prediction or estimation accuracy

\footnotesize Leads to the following search strings:

* \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Population:}} `software OR application OR product OR web OR www OR Internet OR World-Wide Web OR project OR development`
* \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Intervention:}} `cross company OR cross organization OR cross organisation OR multiple-organizational OR multiple-organizational model OR modeling OR modelling effort OR cost OR resource estimation OR prediction OR assessment` 
* \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Comparison:}} `within-organization OR within-organization OR within-organizational OR within-organisational OR signle company OR single organisation`
* \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Outcomes:}} `accuracy OR mean magnitude relative error`

# Search String Examples

The Final Search string becomes:

\scriptsize
```
(software OR application OR product OR web OR www OR Internet OR World-Wide Web OR project OR development) 
AND (cross company OR cross organization OR cross organisation OR multiple-organizational OR 
     multiple-organizational model OR modeling OR modelling effort OR cost OR resource estimation OR 
     prediction OR assessment)
AND (within-organization OR within-organization OR within-organizational OR within-organisational OR 
     single company OR single organisation)
AND (accuracy OR mean magnitude relative error)
```

# Exercise

Take the next 5 minutes, using the same sheet of paper from before, for each of the PICO items define a set of search strings:

\vskip.5em

* \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Population?}}

\vskip.5em

* \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Intervention?}}

\vskip.5em

* \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Comparison?}}

\vskip.5em

* \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Outcomes?}}

# Database Selection

* \small A single database is usually not enough to identify your primary studies.

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small Using multiple databases will inevitably result in duplicates, but a greater sample of the population as well.

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small For CS/SE Studies you should use at least the following:
  - \footnotesize IEEExplore
  - \footnotesize ACM Digital Library

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small You should use 2 or more general indexes such as:
  - \footnotesize INSPEC/Compendex
  - \footnotesize Web of Science

# Database Selection

* \small Additionally, you can use the following indexes
  - \footnotesize ScienceDirect
  - \footnotesize SpringerLink

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Do NOT use Google Scholar}} since the results are not replicable

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small Realize: you cannot find all primary studies for a given topic, and the what is found is simply a sample

# Search Execution

* \small Keep a detailed record or the search findings.
  - \footnotesize Number found
  - \footnotesize Included studies
  - \footnotesize Excluded studies
  - \footnotesize Duplicate studies
  
\vskip.5em
\pause
  
\small \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{When to Stop Searching}}

* \footnotesize Search is a time-consuming process, and we will never be able to find all of the papers.

\vskip.5em
\pause	

* \footnotesize To save time, adopt search stoppage criteria (and don't forget to note them in the report)
  - \scriptsize If using database and another complementary search (manual or snowball)
    - \tiny Stop when the manual or snowball does not return a certain number of selected studies (i.e., < 4 new studies added to the list of primary studies)
  - \scriptsize Use a time budget (based on funding or time constraints) and create a list of reviewed studies and a list of not considered studies

# Snowball Sampling

* \small Snowball sampling is simply a manual search for primary studies based on a selection of identified primary studies.

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small There are two types of snowball sampling:

\pause

::: columns
:::: {.column width=.1}
::::
:::: {.column width=.45}

\small \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Backward Snowballing}}

* \footnotesize Search the references of a primary study for new primary studies

* \footnotesize Can be done either by:
  - \scriptsize Searching actual paper reference section, or
  - \scriptsize Searching through listed references on online paper listing

::::
:::: {.column width=.45}

\pause
\small \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Forward Snowballing}}

* \footnotesize Search the items citing a primary study for new primary studies
* \footnotesize Can be done either by:
  - \scriptsize Using Google scholar cited-by listings
  - \scriptsize Using "Citations" section at paper listing
::::
:::

\pause

* \footnotesize After each round, you will need to apply inclusion/exclusion criteria

\pause

* \footnotesize This process continues until no new studies are added

# Primary Study Selection

* \small Primary studies are selected based on a set of well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria
  - \footnotesize These need to be defined before the search is conducted to reduce bias

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small To reduce threats to validity it is wise to have more than one reviewer
  - \footnotesize Because selection is based on researcher judgment, you need to address this
  - \footnotesize After all researchers have made their assessments
    * \scriptsize Measure the \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{inter-rater agreement}} with \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Cohen's Kappa}}
    * \scriptsize Use the \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Think-Aloud technique}} to attempt to come to a consensus
    * \scriptsize Measure the inter-rater agreement again
    * \scriptsize Report all of this in the final report

# Primary Study Selection

* \small Studies are selected based on researcher judgment and the application of inclusion/exclusion criteria

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small Reducing the search results to the set of primary studies should be done in an iterative fashion
  - \footnotesize Start by removing those which can easily be excluded from their title or abstract alone
  - \footnotesize Next expand to those studies which can be excluded by their introduction and conclusions
  - \footnotesize The remaining studies should be thoroughly reviewed by a full text reading

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small Remove any papers with more than one version (conference and journal) keeping only the most recent version

# Inclusion and Exclusion

* \small We need to define inclusion/exclusion criteria to select our primary studies.

  \vskip.5em
  \pause

  - \footnotesize The relevance of the topic of the article -> does it answer the research questions
  - \footnotesize The venue of publication and type of publication
  - \footnotesize The time period considered (typically 10 years, usually excluding the current partial year)
  - \footnotesize Requirements on evaluation (avoid if research has not yet reached maturation for evaluation)
  - \footnotesize Restrictions with respect to language

# Inclusion/Exclusion Examples

::: columns
:::: column

\small \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Inclusion Criteria}}

* \footnotesize "English peer-reviewed articles in conferences or journals published until Dec. 2011"

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \footnotesize "Articles that focus on software product lines"

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \footnotesize "Articles that provide some type of evolution of existing software artifacts, included among the terms selected"

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \footnotesize "Context, objectives, and research method are reasonably present"

::::
:::: column

\pause

\small \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Exclusion Criteria}}

* \footnotesize "Articles that are not related to software product lines"

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \footnotesize "Articles that do not imply evolution of any software artifact"

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \footnotesize "Non-peer reviewed publications"

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \footnotesize "Articles that are not written in English"

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \footnotesize "Context, objectives, or research method are manifestly missing"

::::
:::

# Publication Bias

* \small There is a bias associated with published primary studies
  - \footnotesize They typically focus on positive results and discount negative results

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small To overcome this bias you should consider gray literature
  - \footnotesize Technical Reports
  - \footnotesize Dissertations and Theses
  - \footnotesize Rejected Publications
  - \footnotesize Works in progress

# Study Quality Assessment

* \small Primary study quality is important as it
  * \footnotesize Can be used to analyze cause of contradicting results
  * \footnotesize Can be used in weighting the value of evidence from primary studies

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small We measure quality through the use of checklists, several of which have been published

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small Note that the quality of the study not the reporting are to be evaluated

# Data Extraction

* \small After primary studies are selected, data is extracted.

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small A form for data collection should be developed from research questions
  - \footnotesize Expedites data collection
  - \footnotesize Increases reliability of data collection

\vskip.5em
\pause

* \small You should conduct a small data extraction using your forms on a subset of studies to validate the form

# Data Synthesis

\small There are several approaches to synthesize the data from a literature review

\pause

* \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Meta-analysis}} (most advanced and most constrained)
  - \scriptsize Requires primary studies to be of the same type, with the same hypotheses, have the same measures, and report on the same explanatory factors

\pause

* \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Descriptive synthesis}} - tabulation of data to shed light on research questions
  - \scriptsize Should include sample size of each intervention, estimates of effect sizes, differences in means (with CI), and units for effect measurements

\pause

* \footnotesize Qualitative approaches for inhomogenous and mixed-method studies. These approaches include but are not limited to:
  - \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Thematic anslysis}} - analysis of patterns or themes in primary studies
  - \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Natrative synthesis}} - the story originating in the primary studies
  - \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Comparative analysis}} - logic to explain cause and effect
  - \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Case survey}} - aggregate primary studies using a survey instrument (can be analyzed using statistical methods)

\pause

\small Independent of approach used, a sensitivity analysis should take place

<!--
# Meta-Analysis

* \small Most advanced form of data synthesis

\vskip.5em

* \small Assumptions
  - \footnotesize primary studies are homogenous
  - \footnotesize or cause of in-homogeneity is known

\vskip.5em

* \small Compares \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{effect sizes}} and \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{p}} values to assess synthesized outcome

\vskip.5em

* \small Primarily applicable to replication studies

# Meta-Analysis

* \small Studies to be included in a meta-analysis must:
  - \footnotesize Be of the same type, for example, formal experiments
  - \footnotesize Have the same test hypothesis
  - \footnotesize Have the same measures of the treatment and effect constructs
  - \footnotesize Report the same explanatory factors

\vskip.5em

* \small Process
  1. \footnotesize Decide which studies to include in the meta-analysis
  2. \footnotesize Extract the effect size from the primary study report, or estimate if there is no effect size published
  3. \footnotesize Combine the effect sizes from the primary studies to estimate and test the combined effect.

# Meta-Analysis

* \small In addition to the procedures noted
  - \footnotesize Include an analysis of \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{publication bias}}
    - \scriptsize Funnel plots - where observed effect sizes are plotted against measure of study size (inverse of variance or other dispersion measure)

\vskip.5em

* \small Effect size (i.e. difference between mean values) for each study
  - \footnotesize normalize between studies by dividing by combined standard deviation

\vskip.5em

* \small Statistical evaluation
  1. \footnotesize Determine homogeneity by evaluating heterogeneity using either the \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Q test}} or \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Likelihood Ratio test}}
  2. \footnotesize Homogenous studies use a fixed-effects model
  3. \footnotesize Inhomogenous studies use a random effects model

# Descriptive Synthesis

* \small tabulates data from the primary studies to shed light on the research questions

\vskip.5em

* \small tabulated data should contain the following, at a minimum:
  - \footnotesize Sample size for each intervention
  - \footnotesize Estimates of effect size for each intervention (with standard errors)
  - \footnotesize Difference between mean values for each intervention
  - \footnotesize Confidence interval for the differences
  - \footnotesize Units used for measuring the effect

\vskip.5em

* \small Forest plot can visualize
  - \footnotesize means of difference between treatments of each study
  - \footnotesize variance of difference between treatments of each study

# Qualitative Approaches

* \small \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Thematic Analysis}} - aims at identifying, analyzing and reporting patterns or themes in the primary studies. At a minimum, it organizes and presents the data in rich detail, and interprets various aspects of the topic under study.

\vskip1em

* \small \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Narrative Synthesis}} - tells the story originating from the primary evidence.

\vskip1em

* \small \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Comparative Analysis}} - aims at analyzing complex causal connections. It uses Boolean logic to explain relations between cause and effect in the primary studies.

# Qualitative Approaches

* \small \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Case Survey}} - Aggregates existing research by applying a survey instrument of specific questions to each primary study. The data from the survey is quantitative and is aggregated using statistical methods.

\vskip1em

* \small \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Meta-ethnography}} - translates studies into one another, and synthesizes the translations into concepts beyond the individual studies. The data is the interpretations and explanations in the primary studies.

\vskip1em

* \small \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Meta-Analysis}} - can use statistical methods to integrate quantitative data from several cases
