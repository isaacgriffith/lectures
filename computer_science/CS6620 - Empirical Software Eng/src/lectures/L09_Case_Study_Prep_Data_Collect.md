# Outline

* Case study preparation
* Data sources and collection techniques
* Interviews
* Observation
* Archival data
* Metrics

# Case Study Preparation

* When preparing a case study we need to:
  - Consider the number of data sources
  - Types of data sources
  - Methods of data collection

# Multiple Data Sources

* Multiple data sources
  - Reduce the effects of a single interpretation from a single data source
  - sharing the same conclusion result, via triangulation, a stronger conclusion than a single data source

* Additionally, we should take into account
  - multiple roles of subjects
  - differences between subjects/situations

# Data Collection Techniques

::: columns
:::: column
\footnotesize
* First Degree: Direct method placing researchers with the subjects
  - Interviews
  - Focus Groups
  - Surveys
  - Observations
* Second Degree: Indirect collection of raw data without interacting with subjects
  - logging the use of tools
  - Observation via video
* Third Degree: Independent analysis of artifacts or compiled data
  - Archival data
  - Metrics

* Cost/Effort
  - First Degree - Most expensive
  - Third Degree - Least expensive

* Control
  - First and Second Degree
    - High control of data collection
    - High control of form of data collected
  - Third Degree
    - Low control of data collection
    - Low control of data quality

# Interviews

* **Idea:** Researcher asks a series of questions to a set of subjects about the area of interest of the study

* Interview questions are based on research questions
  - **Open Questions** - allow for a broad range of answers
  - **Closed Questions** - limit answers to a set of known alternatives

* Interview types:
  - **Unstructured** - General concerns and interests
  - **Semi-structured** - Planned questions, no specific order
  - **Fully structured** - Planned questions, specific order

# Interview Planning

* Decide whom to interview
  - focus on subject differences rather similarities
  - involve different roles, personalities, etc.

* Select number of interviewees
  - sufficient such that interviews reach **saturation**
    - that is no new info is learned by end of interviews

# Interview Session Process

* Present Objectives - explain how the data will be used
* Introductory Questions - simple to answer questions about the background of the subject
* Main Questions - largest part of interview
  - ensure the confidentiality of the interviewee
* Summarize Findings - summarize key findings and elicit feedback to avoid misunderstandings

# Observations

* Observations provide a deeper understanding of a phenomena
* Sources of observational data:
  - "Think aloud protocols"
  - Audio or Video recordings
  - Keylogging
  - Observing meetings

* Category 1 or 2 -- Action research or Ethnographic Studies
* Category 1 vs 2 -- researches are seen as "observing" rather as "normal" participants
* Category 3 -- Researcher seen only as a researcher
* Category 4 -- Subjects observed using second degree methods such as video recordings

# Archival Data

* A third degree type of data
* Refers to data such as
  - Meeting minutes
  - Development documentation
  - Organizational charts
  - Financial records
  - Previously collected measurements
* Must keep in mind that the data was not originally intended for the study

# Metrics

* Quantitative data is also important
* Can be defined for the study or be repurposed data
* Data explicitly for the study is more flexible and more likely suitable for answering research questions
  - Utilize the GQM
* If repurposed data is used need to possibly handle the problem of missing data
