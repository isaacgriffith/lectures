# Technology {-}

In this course we will be heavily relying upon software development tools. Specifically we will be using:

* Java 11
* JUnit 5
* Gradle
* Jenkins CI/CD
* And several tools to be identified during the course of the semester, please be sure that you have a system which can run these tools and that you have the skills to install and execute them.
