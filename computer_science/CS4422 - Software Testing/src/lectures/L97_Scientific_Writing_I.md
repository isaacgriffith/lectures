# Writing in Science

* Writing is as important a tool in your toolbox as algorithms, data structures, design patterns, etc.
* Improving your writing will help you become successful
* Writing forms the bridge to your audience

Remember: It is the author's job to make the reader's job easy

# Writing vs. Rewriting

* Get something down on paper as fast as possible
* Then take this and revise.
  - Goal: each revision, or draft, is clearer and easier to understand

* This rewriting cycle develops both your writing and your thinking -> yielding clarity and power

# Storytelling

* It is our job to communicate the story of our science.
  - This requires you to assess your data and evaluate the possible explanations consistent with existing knowledge and theory
  - The story grows from the data, thus we should not go into it with a story in mind before we collect the data.

* Our characters are not people (well sometimes) but rather code, statements, classes, objects, methods, build scripts, docker instances, algorithms, and variables (among others)
  - We develop these characters in our papers and we discuss them and what makes them tick

* We must do more than simply present facts

# Finding the Story

* It seems reasonable to simply write a paper as follows:
  - outline everything you did
  - then say something abut it
* But within this there is a story waiting to come out
* Our ultimate goal is not to simply present results
* Rather, we want to tell the story of the understanding we derived from them
* From the limits of our data, comes our story
  - What did the outliers tell us?

# Aspects of Story Telling

1. Content -- what makes a story engage and stay with us?
2. Structure -- how do you put together that content to make it easy for us to get?
3. Language -- how do you write the story in the most compelling ways possible?

# Making a Story Sticky

Why do some ideas stay with you while others are eminently forgettable?

* \underline{\textbf{S}}imple
* \underline{\textbf{U}}nexpected
* \underline{\textbf{C}}oncrete
* \underline{\textbf{C}}redible
* \underline{\textbf{E}}motional
* \underline{\textbf{S}}tories

# Making a Story Sticky

::: columns
:::: column
\footnotesize
**Simple** (not simplistic)

* Simple ideas stick
  \scriptsize
  - contains core essence of an important idea
  - presented in clear compact way

\footnotesize
**Unexpected** (novelty)

* Unexpectedness lies in:
  \scriptsize
  - Questions you ask
  - Interpretations you develop
\footnotesize
* Goal is to highlight the unexpected knowledge
  \scriptsize
  - engage the readers curiosity
::::
:::: column
\footnotesize

**Concrete**

\scriptsize

* Connect readers to your concepts (abstractions) and theory
* Do this through the use of concrete examples
* Through this, the concept becomes concrete

\footnotesize

**Credible**

\scriptsize

* Credibility emerges from grounding our ideas in previous work
* Data credibility is established through describing our methods
* Conclusion credibility grows from credible data
* This all builds a chain extending from past work into future directions
  - Don't break the chain

# Making a Story Sticky

**Emotional**

* Unexpected things create curiosity
* Use this to engage emotion
  - Shift from "what information do I have to offer?",
  - To "what knowledge do I have to offer?"
* Thus, you must learn to excite your readers

::::
:::: column
**Stories**

* Stories are modular
  - A single large story is composed of smaller story units threaded together
* To write a good paper, think about
  - internal structure
  - integration of story modules

# Story Structure - OCAR

There are four elements that underlie the structure of all stories (The OCAR Model):

::: columns
:::: column
* **Opening (O)**:
  - Whom is the story about?
  - Who are the characters?
  - When does it take place?
  - What do you need to understand about the situation to follow the story?
  - What is the larger problem you are addressing?
* **Challenge (C)**:
  - What specific question do you propose to answer?
::::
:::: column
* **Action (A)**:
  - What happens to address the challenge? In a paper this describes the work you did; in a proposal, it describes the work you hope to do.
* **Resolution (R)**:
  - How have the characters and their world changed as a result of the action? This is your conclusion -- what did you learn from your work?

# Story Structure

::: columns
:::: column
* We want and need to know how our characters have changed for a story to be satisfying
* Thus we must close the loop
  - A good story is a spiral
  - At the end it must come back to the beginning
  - But the beginning has moved

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.65\textwidth]{images/Research/funnel.eps}
\end{center}

# The Opening

* You must start well.
* Your first sentences get readers moving and set the direction
* The opening begins with a single sentence but typically encompasses the first paragraph

**Bad Openings**

* Misdirection
* No Direction

# Targeting Your Audience

* Know your audience
* Tailor your opening to them
* For a very broad audience, use a two-step opening
  1. Open with an issue for your target audience, but modulate it for the general audience
  2. Redefine the focus as you develop the opening
* Your opening should only be as wide as the resolution allows

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{images/Research/funnels.eps}
\end{center}

# The Funnel

* The opening identifies a large problem
* The challenge defines a specific question
* The body of the introduction must connect these two
  - This is done through the framing of a knowledge gap.
  - Furthermore, this taps the U of SUCCES
* Remember to first define the problem, then propose a solution
* The goal of the background section should be:
  - To connect the introduction and challenge such that
  - Readers feel the questions you pose are obvious and essential

# The Challenge

* Describe the knowledge you hope to gain:
  - First state your research questions
  - Then briefly summarize your approach

::: columns
:::: column
* **Good challenges**
  - Clearly state the objectives and questions
  - Clearly lay out the approach
  - Build unexpectedness and curiosity in the reader
::::
:::: column
* **Bad challenges**
  - Unclear
  - leave reader adrift
  - focus on objectives rather than questions
::::

# Action

* The main body of the story including:
  - Methods and Materials
  - Results
  - Discussion (most of it at least)

* In a proposal, this is a description of what you intend to do.

* This section gives your story structure and direction

# Methods

* Meant to report the results you achieved and the methods used
* Should follow the Lead/Development (LD) structure
  - provide an initial overview for all
  - then the details for those who need them

# Results & Discussion

* Describe the outcome: your findings and interpretations

* Two core principles
  1. Make the reader's job easy: present results and interpretation in a way that develops the story
  2. Readers must be able to distinguish between your findings and your thoughts

* There are 3 types of material in a paper
  1. Data: the actual results
  2. Inference: clear and robust interpretations of data that any practitioner would draw
  3. Interpretation: your thoughts, hypotheses, and speculation about the results within the context of the larger problem

# Presenting Data

* You can't show the raw data
* So select the data that confers the story

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{images/Research/charts.png}
\end{center}

# Statistics & Stories

* Statistics are quite useful
  - they allow us to distinguish treatment effects from random variation
  - they establish credibility of your conclusions
* Remember, the story is not the statistics, it is the data
  - make the stats support
  - focus on the data
  - your story stays engaging without forgoing rigor
* Statistics values (such as a p-value) are results
* Leave the significance tests to interpretation

# Discussion

* This is where you present your thoughts and interpretations
* Presenting your answers to the questions
* Where you show your contribution to the larger problem framed in the opening

\vskip1em

* This takes a bit of creativity



# The Resolution

* This is your "Take-Home Message", your strongest and most memorable words
* You want to
  - show how our understanding has been advanced
  - offer new insights into the problem
  - wrap up your story
* If you include anything but the new insight, then
  - you undercut the resolution
  - and with that, the entire paper
  - DON'T BLOW IT

# Bad Resolutions

* Are Weak
  - they do not say something concrete
* Are Distracting
  - they neither synopsize nor synthesize results
* Undermine Your Conclusions

**Fixing a Bad Resolution**

* Pare away dead tissue
  - remove the fluff, distractions, and new ideas
* Condense to do the following
  1. Synopsize the key results
  2. Synthesize those results (show how they answer the questions)
  3. Show how this contributes to solving the larger problem

# Internal Structure

::: columns
:::: column
* OCAR defines the overall structure
  - Opening - grabs attention with characters and setting
  - Challenge - creates uncertainty and curiosity
  - Action - provides info and develops story
  - Resolution - rewards the reader and relieves the tension
* This creates an overall story arc
