# Internal Structure

::: columns
:::: column
* OCAR defines the overall structure
  - Opening - grabs attention with characters and setting
  - Challenge - creates uncertainty and curiosity
  - Action - provides info and develops story
  - Resolution - rewards the reader and relieves the tension
* This creates an overall story arc

# Internal Structure

* A story has a spiral structure
  - moving forward and returning to where it started at the end
* Successful writing creates that flow and that arc
* A paper's structure is:
  - sections, composed of
  - subsections, composed of ...
  - ... paragraphs, composed of
  - sentences

# Internal Structure

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/Research/arc02.eps}
\end{center}

# Internal Structure

* Creating arcs compartmentalizes your thoughts and makes them manageable
* For each new point we build a structure and form a small story arc
* These arcs are then linked together

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{images/Research/arc03.eps}
\end{center}

* This structure works on the premise that the beginning and endings are power positions
  - These positions help guide the reader
* Try to root out extraneous thoughts that break the serial nature

# Effective Arcs

* The prior concepts told us how to build arcs
* We also can understand that these same principles apply at all levels of organization

\vskip1em

* Evaluating Internal Structure
  - Does each unit make a single, clear point?
  - When several paragraphs together form a section, are the linkages among them clear?
  - Has every extraneous thought that breaks the serial arc structure been removed?
  - When you introduce a topic, do you resolve the discussion before introducing a new topic?
  - Is every major unit of the work defined by either a subhead or clear opening text

* A "No" to any question indicates you still need to work on the structure.

# Paragraphs

Paragraphs are the "unit of composition"

::: columns
:::: column
* Three forms:
  - TS-D - Topic Sentence-Development (point-first)
  - LD - Lead/Development (point-first)
  - LDR - Lead/Development (point-last)

* Bad Paragraphs
  - fail to tell stories
  - lack coherent structure
::::
:::: column
* Fixing Paragraphs
  1. Determine the real story
  2. Pick either a point-first or point-last structure
  3. Pull apart story threads to clarify relationships

* Shorter tends to be better than long
::::

# Sentences

* A sentence has components: Subject, Verb, Object
* These map to story units that carry out the OCAR functions:
  - O -- Opening: who is the story about? = Subject
  - C/A -- Challenge/Action: what happened = Verb
  - R -- Resolution: what was its outcome? = Object

\vskip1em

# Topic and Stress

* **Topic**: critical opening position
* **Stress**: critical resolution position

\vskip1em

* A sentence should focus on a single character, the topic.
  - Readers interpret the beginning of the sentence as the topic

* The last words of a sentence carry the greatest weight
  - put the stress of the sentence here

* If you change this ordering, you change the meaning.

# Managing Sentences

* Connect the Subject and Verb
  - The verb should immediately follow the subject
  - Otherwise it is hard to follow
* Managing complex sentences, boils down to uncluttering the Topic, Action, Stress structure.

* **Unburying the Stress**
  1. Fix the topic
     - should be short and clear
     - main verb should immediately follow
  2. Fix the Stress
     - this is where the key message should be
  3. Finish
     - package everything else in the middle  

# Flow

2 Approaches for Creating Flow

1. Write paragraphs where all sentences are on the same team
   - Coherent theme
   - Working together for a common goal
2. Write sentences so the team forms a relay
   - Each passes a baton at the transition
   - Allowing an idea to flow cleanly from start to finish

* Paragraph opening sets the theme
  - If all sentences have a topic that fits the theme they will hang together

# Flow

Challenge: Ensuring readers do not derail at the transition

* Help them follow you through your arguments and between story arcs
* Sentences need to link seamlessly to each other
* Each sentence must tell a coherent story, while functioning to advance the larger story
* You must tie together stress and top, weaving old and new information in an unbroken chain
* Paragraphs are linked similarly

# Flow

* Avoid list structure if possible
* Short lists can be okay
* Long lists confuse readers

# Energizing Writing

* Good stories are driven by action
  - "Show, don't tell"
* Action is the job of verbs, use them well
  - Otherwise your writing is overburdened

**Overburdening your Writing**

1. Passive Voice
2. Fuzzy Verbs
3. Nominalizations

# Passive vs. Active Voice

::: columns
:::: {.column width=.55}
**Active Voice**

```
John         called         Jane
Actor        Action         Acted-on
Subject      Verb           Object
```

**Passive Voice**

```
Jane         was called     by John
Acted-on     Action         Actor
Subject      Verb           Object
```
::::
:::: {.column width=.45}

**Example:**

* Active: Soil porosity influences water retention.
* Passive: Water retention in soil is influenced by porosity.

\vskip1em
**Example:**

* Active: A magnetospheric source produces variable electric fields.
* Passive: Variable electric fields are produced by a magnetospheric source.

# Fuzzy Verbs

* **Fuzzy Verbs**: say that something happened but not what
  - Steal energy by telling and not showing
* **Action Verbs**: powerful, concrete storytelling tools.

+---------------------------+------------+---------+------------+
| **Fuzzy Verbs (Weak)**    |            |         |            |
+:==========================+:===========+:========+:===========+
| Occur                     | Facilitate | Conduct | Implement  |
+---------------------------+------------+---------+------------+
| Affect                    | Perform    |         |            |
+---------------------------+------------+---------+------------+

+---------------------------+------------+---------+------------+
| **Action Verbs (Strong)** |            |         |            |
+:==========================+:===========+:========+:===========+
| Modify                    | Increase   | React   | Accelerate |
+---------------------------+------------+---------+------------+
| Accomplish                | Decrease   | Inhibit | Migrate    |
+---------------------------+------------+---------+------------+
| Create                    | Invade     | Disrupt |            |
+---------------------------+------------+---------+------------+

# Nominalizations

* You can kill the entire action by turning a verb into a noun.

**Examples**

+----------+--------------------+
| **Verb** | **Nominalization** |
+:=========+:===================+
| Move     | Movement           |
+----------+--------------------+
| Differ   | Difference         |
+----------+--------------------+
| Suggest  | Suggestion         |
+----------+--------------------+
| Interact | Interaction        |
+----------+--------------------+
| Analyze  | Analysis           |
+----------+--------------------+
| Develop  | Development        |
+----------+--------------------+

# Words

* Choosing words is not easy.
* English has amassed works from many sources
* Academics have a fondness for long, heavy words
  - but this is not necessary to be effective

\vskip1em

**Jargon vs. Technical Term**

* **Jargon:** (A) a term that refers to a schema the reader does not hold. (B) A term for which there is an adequate plain language equivalent
* **Technical term:** (A) a term that refers to a schema the reader **does** hold. (B) A term for which either there is no plain language equivalent or where using it would be confusing.

\vskip.5em

* Remember to define terms before using them (and at the end of a sentence), and in the right place to ensure flow.

# Condensing

* Condensing keeps your ideas from becoming
  - buried in words, cumbersome sentences, and extraneous info
* Prevents your readers from getting confused and frustrated

::: columns
:::: column

* There are two approaches
  1. Tighten up your ideas and language (harder)
  2. Formatting tricks (cheating)

::::
:::: column

**Condensing Strategy**

* Identify the following targets for the [Delete] key
  - Redundancies
  - Obvious
  - Modifiers: adjectives and adverbs
  - Metadiscourse
  - Verbosity
::::
:::

# Condensing

**Redundancies**

* Sometimes we use several words where one is all that is needed:
  - Ex: "I will develop, test, and apply a new synthetic approach to produce photovoltaic plastics."
    * Testing is part of developing
    * "synthetic" and "produce" both refer to making things
  - Revision: "I will develop a new approach to produce photovoltaic plastics."

**Obvious**

* Remove ideas that are well known or implied and so don't need to be said
  - Ex: "There is evidence that X17-production can be associated with enzyme induction (Chu et al. 2008)."
    * If there wasn't evidence for this, you wouldn't have said it (and there wouldn't be a citation)
  - Revision: "X-17 production can be associated with enzyme induction (Chu et al. 2008)."

# Condensing

**Modifiers: Adjectives and Adverbs**

* These are not your friends
* Good words do not need modifiers
* Eliminate unnecessary modifiers to make your writing stronger and tighter

**Good Modifiers**

* These don't just reinforce but clarify or define their referent
* Some, rather than amplifying, alter the meaning. These are powerful.

# Condensing

::: columns
:::: column
**Metadiscourse**

* Discussing the discussion:
  - We found that...
  - We argue that...
  - Our initial hypothesis was that...
  - These data may indicate...
  - To conclude...
* Avoid unnecessary metadiscourse
::::
:::: column
**Verbosity**

* the sum of multiple types of filler
* sentences that ramble on endlessly
* Indication of an author that is
  - insecure
  - afraid to make a definitive statement
  - can't separate their mental processes from the story
::::
:::

# Editing

* \underline{\textbf{S}}tructure: get the structure of the story into shape
* \underline{\textbf{C}}larity: ensure that your ideas are clear and concrete
* \underline{\textbf{F}}low: make the ideas flow, linking one thought to the next
* \underline{\textbf{L}}anguage: make it sound good

\vskip1em

* These overlap, and require many iterations

\vskip1em

* Final Technique: **Read it out loud**
