> "Science, done right, works hard to respect absolutely no authority at all other than experience and empirical data. It never succeeds entirely, but it comes closer and has a better track record than any other method we apes have found for learning about the world around us." -- Adam Becker

# 5 Classes of Methods

* Controlled Experiments
* Case Studies
* Survey Research
* Ethnographies
* Action Research

# Exploratory Questions

* Existence
* Description and Classification
* Descriptive-Comparative

# Base-Rate Questions

* Frequency and Distribution
* Descriptive-process

# Relationship Questions

* Is X related to Y?
* If X occurs, will Y also occur?

# Causality Questions

* Does X cause Y? Does X prevent Y?
* Causality-Comparative
* Does context affect causality?

# Design Questions

* How to effectively achieve X?
* What helps?
* What does not help?

# Empirical Truth

\begin{center}
\Large\textbf{Epistemology}\\ the nature of human knowledge,\\ and how we obtain it.

\vskip2em

\Large\textbf{Onthology}\\ the nature of the world\\ irrespective of our attempts\\ to understand it.
\end{center}

# Plato: On Knowledge

\vfill
\begin{center}
\Large to know something, you must\\ believe it to be true, and\\ have a clear justification for\\ believing it to be true
\end{center}

# Constructivists

\vfill
\begin{center}
\Large we cannot separate knowledge\\ from the language we use to\\ express it
\end{center}

# The Philosophical Stances

* Positivism
* Constructivism
* Critical Theory
* Pragmatism

# Positivism

* All knowledge comes from a set of basic observable facts.
* Reductionist
* Sometimes comes to wrong conclusions
* Associated to controlled experiment

# Constructivism

* Interpretivism
* Often adopted in social sciences
* Qualitative data about human beings
* Exploratory case studies or survey research

# Critical Theory

* Political act
* Emancipatory and advogacy role
* e.g. Open Source movement and Agile Community
* Action research and case studies

# Pragmatism

* All knowledge is approximate and incomplete and depends on methods
* Truth is whatever works for me
* Truth is relative to observer
* Values practical knowledge
* Mixed methods

# Abstract

* **To the positivist**, science is the process of verifying theories by testing hypotheses derived from them.
* **To the constructivist**, science is the process of seeking local theories that emerge from (and explain) the data.
* **To the critical theorist**, theories are assertions of knowledge (and therefor power), to be critiqued in terms of how they shape that power.
* **To the pragmatist**, theories are the products of a consensual process among a community of researchers to be judged for their practical utility.

# Theories

\vfill
\begin{center}
\Large Theory becomes a "lens" through\\ which the world is observed
\end{center}

# Theories

\vfill
\begin{center}
\Large Real-world phenomena\\ are simply too rich and\\ complex to study without a\\ huge amount of filtering
\end{center}

# Theories

\vfill
\begin{center}
\Large Software Engineering\\ researchers have\\ traditionally been very\\ poor at making theories
\end{center}

# Method Selection

\vfill
\begin{center}
\Large \textbf{Research Design} is the\\ process of selecting a\\ method for a particular\\ problem
\end{center}

# Controlled Experiments

* Independent variables effects over dependent ones
* Precondition: a clear hypothesis
* Demonstrate hypothesis by testing it on a representative population
* Control unwanted variables
* If critical variables are ignored, experiment might not generalize real world
* Theory-driven is both a strength and a weakness

# Case Studies

* Exploratory or confirmatory
* Critical case
* Multiple case
* Weakness: open to interpretation and researcher bias
* All philosophical stances

# Survey Research

* Questionnaires for data collection
* Representative sample from well defined population
* Challenge: control of sampling bias
* Harder challenge: ensure that questions are designed in a way that yields useful and valid data
* Positivism tradition

# Ethnographies

* Goal: study community of people
* Result: a rich description of it
* Participant observation -- possible if researcher is technical person
* Challenge: avoid preconceptions on data observation and analysis
* Constructivism

# Action Research

* Solve real-problem while studying it. Researcher is also a change agent.
* Education, information science fields
* Long term commitment, expensive
* Is a new idea, immature method
* Iterative process
* No attempt to create a control group
* Critical theory

# Mixed-Methods

* Sequential explanatory - quantitative followed by qualitative
* Sequential exploratory - qualitative followed by quantitative
* Concurrent triangulation - what people say is different from what people do
* Difficult to resolve contradictions

# Data Collection

* Each technique has its strengths and weaknesses
* If different kinds of data support the same conclusions, it strengthens the study
* Pilot-test the data collection

# Empirical Validity

* Conclusion -- validity of the (statistical) relationship between the treatment and the outcome
* Internal -- validity of a causal relationship between the treatment and outcome
* Construct -- validity of the relationship between theory and observation
* External -- validity of the generalizability of the relationships
* Reliability -- extent to which the data and analysis are dependent on specific researchers
