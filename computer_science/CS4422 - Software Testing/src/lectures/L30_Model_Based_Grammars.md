> "More than the act of testing, the act of designing tests is one of the best bug preventers known. The thinking that must be done to create a useful test can discover and eliminate bugs before they are coded â€“ indeed, test-design thinking can discover and eliminate bugs at every stage in the creation of software, from conception to specification, to design, coding and the rest." -- Boris Beizer

# Model-based Grammars

\begin{block}{}
\centering
\textbf{\underline{Model-based}}
languages that describe software in abstract terms
\end{block}

* **Formal** specification languages
  - Z, SMV, OCL, ...
* **Informal** specification languages
* **Design** notations
  - Statecharts, FSMs, UML notations
* **Model-based** languages are becoming more widely used

# Instantiating Grammar-Based Testing

# BNF Grammar Testing

* Terminal symbol coverage and production coverage have only been applied to **algebraic** specifications

\vskip1em

* Algebraic specifications are **not widely used**

\vskip1em

* This is essentially **research-only**, so not covered in this book

# Specification-based Mutation

* A **finite state machine** is essentially a graph **G**
  - Nodes are states
  - Edges are transitions

\vskip1em

* A *formalization* of an FSM is:
  - *States* are **implicitly defined** by declaring variables with limited range
  - The *state space* is then the **Cartesian product** of the ranges of the variables
  - *Initial states* are defined by **limiting the ranges** of some or all of the variables
  - *Transitions* are defined by **rules** that characterize the source and target of each transition

  - if **x = T**, next state has **x = F**

  - if **(T, T)**, next state **y** does not change

  - otherwise, next state has **y = T**
* Any ambiguity in SMV is resolved by the order of the cases
* "**true : x**" corresponds to "**default**" in programming

* Converting from SMV to FSM is mechanical and easy to automate
* SMV notation is **smaller** than graphs for **large** finite state machines

# Using SMV Descriptions

* Finite state descriptions can capture **system behavior** at a very high level - suitable for communicating with end users
* The verification community has built **powerful analysis tools** for finite state machines expressed in SMV
* These tools produce **explicit evidence** for properties that are **not true**
* This "*evidence*" is presented as sequences of states, called "**counterexamples**"
* Counterexamples are *paths* through the FSM that can be used as **test cases**

# Mutations and Test Cases

* Mutating FSMs requires **mutation operators**
* Most FSM mutation operators are **similar** to program language operators

## Constant Replacement Operator:

\footnotesize
* changes a constant to each other constant
* in the **next(y)** case: **!x & y : false** is mutated to **!x & y : true**
* To kill this mutant, we need a **sequence of states** (a path) that the **original machine allows** but the mutated machine **does not**
* This is what **model checkers** do
  \scriptsize
  - Model checkers find **counterexamples** - paths in the machine that violate some **property**
  - Properties are written in "**temporal logic**" - logical statements that are true for some period of time
  - **!x & y : false** has different results from **!x & y : true**

# Counter-Example for FSM

# Counter-Example for FSM

* The model checker should produce:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{images/Testing/Mutation/checker_output.eps}
\end{center}

* This represents a test case that goes from nodes FF to TT to FT to TF in the original FSM
  - The last step in the mutated FSM will be to TT, killing the mutant
* If no sequence is produced, the mutant is equivalent
  - Equivalence is **undecidable** for programs, but **decidable** for FSMs

# Model-Based Grammars Summary

* **Model-Checking** is slowly growing in use

\vskip.5em

* **Finite state machines** can be encoded into model checkers

\vskip.5em

* Properties can be defined on FSMs and model checking used to find **paths that violate** the properties

\vskip.5em

* **No equivalent** mutants

\vskip.5em

* Everything is **finite**
