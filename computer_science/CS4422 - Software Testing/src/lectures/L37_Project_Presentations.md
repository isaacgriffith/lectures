# Project Presentations

* Each group needs to prepare a project presentation that is similar to one given at a conference.

* Since most of you have never been to a conference, or presented at a conference this will be a foreign concept to you.

* Because of this I have prepared and gathered resources you will need for developing the presentation.

* These presentations are to be limited to between 13 and 15 minutes.
  - They must contain the key findings
  - They must have each group member take part
  - They must be uploaded to youtube by the deadline

* Good Luck...
