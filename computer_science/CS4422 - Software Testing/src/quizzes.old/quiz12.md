1. (5 pts.) Answer the following questions for the graph:
```
       N  = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
       N0 = {1}
       Nf = {5}
       E  = { (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 2) }
```

  a. (1 pt.) Draw the graph

  b. (1 pt.) Give one test path that is not a prime path.

  c. (3 pts.) Give all the prime paths in the graph.

2. (5 pts.) For the logic predicate p = ((A ∨ B) ∧ C), give truth assignments that:

  a. Compute the value of p for each truth assignment in the table
     Then mark a pair (**two**!) truth assignments that:
  b. Satisfy **clause coverage** but **not** predicate coverage
  c. Satisfy **predicate coverage** but **not** clause coverage

Give your answers by writing into the table below. For parts (b) and (c) you will mark two and only two cells under CC and two under PC.
