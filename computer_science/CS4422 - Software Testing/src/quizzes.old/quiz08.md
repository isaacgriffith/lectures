1. (2 pts.) Label the following statements about **error state** as being either **T**=true or **F**=false:

     1. __ Debugging can be described as finding the first error state.

     2. __ Error states are visible to end-users.

2. (8 pts.) You have been hired to taste-test in a Skittles factory. (Skittles are fruit-flavored candy.) The factory produces several types of Skittles: **Cherry (red), Lemon (yellow), Lime (green), Green apple (green), Strawberry (red), Berry punch (violet)**, and **Raspberry (blue)**.

  1. (1 pt.) If your coverage criterion says to taste each Skittle **flavor** how many test requirements do you have?



  2. (1 pt.) If your coverage criterion says to taste each Skittle **color** how many test requirements do you have?



  3. (1 pt.) Does the **flavor criterion** subsume the **color criterion**, or the **color criterion** subsume the **flavor criterion**, or does neither subsume the other?



  4. (1 pt.) If you can’t find any green colored Skittles, is that a **controllability** or an **observability** problem?



  5. (2 pts.) If you can’t find any green colored Skittles, what is the maximum coverage level you can achieve for the **flavor criterion**?



  6. (2 pts.) If you can’t find any yellow colored Skittles, what is the maximum coverage level you can achieve for the **color criterion**?
