1. (2 pts.) Answer each question about test criteria with either a **T**=true or **F**=false. An **advantage** of criteria-based test design is:

  1. __ ... we have an engineering rule for when we are finished testing.

  2. __ ... it makes it easy to establish traceability from software artifacts to tests.

2. (6 pts.) The table below gives 3 types of users and actions that each is allowed with a quiz retake scheduling system. Use this table to answer the questions below.

+---------------------------+-----------+----+---------+
| Action                    | Professor | TA | Student |
+:==========================+:=========:+:==:+:=======:+
| Add a new quiz            | X         |    |         |
+---------------------------+-----------+----+---------+
| Add a retake opportunity  | X         |    |         |
+---------------------------+-----------+----+---------+
| Sign up for a quiz retake | X         | X  | X       |
+---------------------------+-----------+----+---------+
| Change a quiz time        | X         | X  |         |
+---------------------------+-----------+----+---------+
| Change a retake time      | X         | X  |         |
+---------------------------+-----------+----+---------+
| View retake schedules     | X         | X  |         |

  a. If test criterion C1 says to test each action once, how many TRs are there?

  b. If test criterion C2 says to test one action for each user, how many TRs are there?

  c. Does C1 subsume C2, C2 subsume C1, both, or neither?

  d. Giving the course ID is which part of an automated test?

  e. If you only have TA access, what is the max overage level you can achieve for C1?

  f. If only the view retake schedules action is working, what is the max coverage level you can achieve for C2?

3. (1 pt.) Design a characteristic and a partitioning for a string input S. **Make it not disjoint**.



4. (1 pt.) An IDM has 5 characteristics, C1, C2, C3, C4, & C5. C1 has 3 blocks, C2 has 2, C3 has 4, C4 has 3, and C5 has 5. How many tests does the *All Combinations (ACoC)* need?
