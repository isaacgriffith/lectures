# Technology {-}

This is a Software Engineering course and thus will heavily rely upon the use of current technology. As a student you are expected to have at your disposal a computer system capable of running a recent operating system such as MacOS X, Windows 10, or Linux. To program in OpenGL your computer will need a graphics card capable of running OpenGL 3.0+. In addition, you will be required to use Git, a professional grade IDE (e.g., JetBrains CLion or Visual Studio) and build system. Furthermore, you, as a future technologist, are responsible for installing and learning to use these tools.
