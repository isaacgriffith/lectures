# Purpose {-}

To explore the challenges of constructing your own ray tracer and to gain a further and deeper understanding of computer graphics in general.

# Assignment {-}

The levels are incremental. You only need to demo the last one. You will be trusted on whether or not you are using Vertex Buffer Objects.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
\item (50\% level) Build a raytracer which only renders a sphere, basic shading, and the ability to output to a ppm file.
\item (60\% level) Improve your raytracer to include shadows, planes, patterns, and a scene/world construct.
\item (70\% level) Improve your raytracer to include reflection, refraction, cubes, cylinders, and groups
\item (80\% level) Improve your raytracer to include triangles, the ability to read Wavefront OBJ files, and constructive solid geometry.
\item (90\% level) Add one of the following features to your raytracer:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Area Lights and Soft Shadows
  \item Spotlights
  \item Focal Blur
  \item Motion Blur
  \item Anti-aliasing
  \item Texture Maps
  \item Normal Perturbation
  \item Torus Primitive
  \item Multithreading Acceleration
  \item Radiosity
  \end{itemize}
\item (100\% level) Add two of the following features to your raytracer (must be different than previous item):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Area Lights and Soft Shadows
  \item Spotlights
  \item Focal Blur
  \item Motion Blur
  \item Anti-aliasing
  \item Texture Maps
  \item Normal Perturbation
  \item Torus Primitive
  \item Multithreading Acceleration
  \item Radiosity
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

# Submission {-}

Demo to me by showing a collection of scenes you have ray traced which include showing off each of the additional features you have developed.
