## Part 1 (2 points each) {-}

Three points are defined by $P_1 = (2, 4, -1)$, $P_2 = (2, 6, 1)$, and $P_3 = (3, 5, 3)$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]
\item Use dot product to compute the angle $P_1P_2P_3$ (i.e., the angle at $P_2$ defined by the three points).
\item Use cross product to compute a normal vector to the plane defined by the three points.
\item Give both unit normal vectors to this plane. If the points $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ are in counterclockwise order, specify which unit normal is pointing up from the surface.
\item Use a normal vector and one of the points to determine the planar equation for this plane.

\end{enumerate}
