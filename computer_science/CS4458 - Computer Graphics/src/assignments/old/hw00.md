* Ensure that you can compile and run OpenGL programs.

# Assignment {-}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\protect\circled{\arabic*}]

\item Make sure that you have OpenGL, FreeGLUT, and GLEW installed on your personal system.
\item Compile and run the `smooth.cpp` program from the class notes.
\item Modify the program to have a smoothly shaded square, with different colors in all four corners, centered in the output window. Change the window size, window location, and background color.

* Full credit will be given if yo complete the assignment by demoing your program before the due date of the assignment. This will require that you setup an appointment with me, come to my office hours, or approach me before/after class.
