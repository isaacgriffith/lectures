Service provides opportunities for students to network with the community, develop new skills, gain confidence and perspective regarding classroom learning, and give back in meaningful ways to the community. Students must complete at least 10 hours of community service during the semester. The service completed for this course can overlap with service rendered for service requirements in other courses.

We have provided a list of service ideas, but students are encouraged to be creative! This is your opportunity to make a difference! As future CS courses may have similar service requirements, you might want to consider a project that would maintain interest over multiple semesters.

Students will submit a service proposal via email to the instructor by the end of the 4th week of the semester. The instructor approves and provides constructive feedback on the proposal. This proposal should include the following:

1. A brief summary of the project, including a description of what research/outreach has been done to ensure the viability of the project
2. An explanation of how the project directly serves Southeast Idaho
3. An explanation of how the project directly relates to computer science
4. A paragraph outlining any ethical, security, or safety considerations inherent in the project
5. Relevant community contacts, contact information, and a description of the contacts role in the project
6. Names of other students working on the same project and a justification for why more than one student is needed to complete the project
7. A proposed timeline with dates and anticipated time spent to complete specific milestones. This should include any time needed for planning, commuting, communicating, marketing, and executing the project. The timeline should demonstrate how the project will meet the 10-hour service requirement. Planning and transportation may count for up to 2.5 hours of the 10-hour requirement.

Students will submit a final service report via Moodle by the last day of class. This report should include:

1. A detailed summary of the project
2. An explanation of how the project directly served Southeast Idaho
3. An explanation of how the project directly related to computer science
4. Insights and reflections on what you learned or how you benefited from the project
5. What next steps or additional service opportunities exist related to this project?
6. A list of other students and relevant community contacts (including contact information) and a description of the role of each in the project
7. A list describing specific service activities, the time spent on each, and the total time spent to complete the project. Planning and transportation may count for up to 2.5 hours of the 10-hour requirement.
