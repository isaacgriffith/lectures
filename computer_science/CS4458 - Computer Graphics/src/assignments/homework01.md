# Topics

# Theory
* Should have some basic transforms (by hand)
* Should have some aspects discussing applications of graphics
* Should have some application of basic mathematics (calculation of local-world and world-local coordinates)
* Should have something to do with raster images

# Application

* Implement the basic Ray-Tracing algorithm to include sphere and cube intersections, phong lighting, specular reflection, and basic shadows.
  - They will need to implement the basic vector and matrix mathematics to make this happen.

* Goal is to implement a simple scene consisting of a cube on a plane with a sphere.

* Implement a basic shader setup including phong lighting and implement the same basic scene as the ray-tracer.

# Grading

* Theory - 20%
* Ray-Tracing - 30%
  - Provide a series of tests for the ray tracer components, in the following languages:
    * C++
    * C#
    * Java
  - Evaluated by the tests, and comparison of generated image to expected image.
* GLSL - 30%
  - Evaluated based on comparison to the expected image.

# Submission

* Submit a pdf of your answers (generated using LaTeX) for the theoretical section, the images generated by your ray-tracer and a screenshot of your opengl program.
