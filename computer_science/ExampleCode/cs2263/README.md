# CS 2263 Examples

This project provides code examples for my students in the 
CS 2263 course at Idaho State University. As the term progresses
the code examples will become more interesting.

## Usage

* Review the code and attempt to apply the examples to homework or skill drills
* These examples correspond to lecture topics
  - files are packaged as follows `edu.isu.cs.cs2253.<topic>` where <topic> is the code topic
  
## Contributing

* I will not accept any contributions to this repo

## Credits

* Nearly all code is original to Isaac Griffith
* Code that is from the book "Object Oriented Analysis, Design and Imlementation" by Dathan and Ramnath will be noted in the code comments
