## Exercises

1. Consider the following software system: A University Course Catalog System
   * Identify the stakeholders of this system (both internal and external)
   * Select at least two stakeholders (as general groups) and describe both their interests and concerns for such a system
2. Compare and contrast the **component** and **structured** methods and their general characteristics:
   * As part of your narrative, describe the relationship between the general notions of methods and practices
   * Using this relationship as a basis: provide examples of practices found in specific instances of these methods.
   * Use these practices and their characteristics as the foundation for the comparison/contrast between the general categories of **component** and **structured** methods.
3. You will be working in teams this semester on your project. Using your previous experience combined with what you are learning this semester: discuss team work while answering the following questions:
   * When forming a team is there an expectation of a baseline set of capabilities for each team member?
   * If so, what are these capabilities and how does this background affect the nature of how the team's practices (i.e., more explicitly or more tacitly) are defined?
   * How do each team member's capabilities affect the dynamics of the team as a whole?
   * How do the team's capabilities affect the dynamics of the software engineering endeavor?
   * **NOTE:** I would consider couching this narrative within the context of an example.
4. Consider the concept of requirements: Identify how requirements play a mediating role between software engineers, stakeholders, and the system to be built. As you are  considering this also discuss the requirements alpha and how the alpha states are related to the role that requirements plays.
5. Consider just the **Software System** alpha. Identify the activity spaces which affect this alpha and describe how each of these would push progress forward and transition the alpha from one state to another.
6. Identify what the expectations of software engineering theory are, and once identified present at least one argument for why theory is needed in software engineering.
7. Consider the following practices discussed in CS 2263:
   * Automated Build with Gradle
   * Unit Testing and Test Driven Development (TDD)
   * Spec Testing and Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

   Select two of these and Essentialize them, providing the following:
     - A diagram showing the relationships between the elements
     - Cards which describe Alphas, Work Products, Activities, and Patterns
     - Show the combined layout of where the activities go in the Standard Activity Spaces
