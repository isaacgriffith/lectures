# Adopting Practices

* When adopting practices, teams do not need to adopt all practices at the same time. Instead they do so one at a time.
* In fact, this was how Smithâ€™s team learned and grew.
  - They started with the kernel. Then they added Scrum Lite to improve their collaboration.
  - They tried User Story Lite, but decided to go for Use Case Lite because it gave them a better requirements structure.
  - They then chose Microservice Lite to help make their software system rapidly deployable.
* Each time they added a practice, they received explicit know-how. Their knowledge about software engineering grew.

# Practice Composition

* Composition of practices is an operation merging two or more practices to form a method.
  - The composition operation has been defined mathematically in Essence to achieve precision.
  - The precision is achieved through the essentialization of practices
  - This means, describing practices using
    * alphas,
    * work products,
    * activity spaces,
    * activities,
    * competencies,
    * patterns.

# Composition

Composition is a merging operation that can be understood intuitively like overlaying overhead projector transparencies on top of one another to form a new image as shown

What would happen if you replace transparency (c) and (e) with transparencies (c2) and (e2)?

# Composition Rules

:::: column

* The previous example shows an important concepts behind valid composition:
* Although the transparencies are physically separate, they are drawn such that the coordinates must match, otherwise you would have the situation where the Christmas star appears on the floor.
  - The Christmas tree anchors the position of all other images.
* The corollary is that **while practices are separate, they are not independent.**
  - **They are dependent on the namespace (e.g. kernel alphas and activity spaces) by which they are composed.**
