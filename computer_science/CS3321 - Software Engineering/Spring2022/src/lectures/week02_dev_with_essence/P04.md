# Practicum

\footnotesize

* Consider your either your CS 2263 Project or your most recent group software project
* In a retrospective way, and for each major checkpoint (or iteration) of the project
  - Consider each alpha, using the checklists associated with the cards (use the PDFs for now), and identify numerical state of the project before and after each iteration.
* Using this data, produce a Kernel State Evolution Table (using excel or a similar tool)
* Finally, produce a Radar Chart of the current state of the system
