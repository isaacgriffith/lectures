# Input Space Coverage

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.825\textwidth]{images/Testing/ISP/structures.eps}
\end{center}

# Benefits of ISP

* Can be **equally applied** at several levels of testing
  - Unit
  - Integration
  - System

* Relatively easy to apply with **no automation**

* Easy to **adjust** the procedure to get more or fewer tests

* No **implementation knowledge** is needed
  - Just the input space

# Input Domains

* The **input domain** for a program contains all the possible inputs to that program
* For even small programs, the input domain is so large that it might as well be **infinite**
* Testing is fundamentally about **choosing finite sets** of values from the input domain
* **Input parameters** define the scope of the input domain
  - Parameters to a method
  - Data read from a file
  - Global variables
  - User level inputs
* Input domains are **partitioned into regions** (blocks)
* At least **one value** is chosen from each block

# Partitioning Domains

* Domain $D$
* Partition Scheme $q$ of $D$
* The partition $q$ defines a sets of blocks, $B_q = b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_q$
* The partition must satisfy two **properties**:
  1. **Disjoint** (no overlap): $b_i \cap b_j = \varnothing, \forall i \ne j, b_i, b_j \in B_q$
  2. **Coverage** (all blocks cover the domain $D$): $\underset{b\in B_{q}}{\bigcup} b = D$

# In Class Exercise

Design a partitioning for all integers. That is, partition integers into blocks such that each block seems to be equivalent in terms of testing.

Make sure your partition is valid:

1. Pairwise disjoint
2. Complete

# Using Partitions - Assumptions

* Choose a **value** from each block
* Each value is assumed to be **equally useful** for testing
* Application to testing
  - Find **characteristics** in the inputs: parameters, semantic descriptions, ...
  - **Partition** each characteristic
  - **Choose tests** by combining values from characteristics
* Example **Characteristics**
  - Whether input X is null
  - Order of the input list F (sorted, inverse sorted, arbitrary, ...)
  - Min separation of two aircraft
  - Input device (DVD, CD, VCR, computer, ...)
  - Hair color, height, major, age

# Choosing Partitions

* Choosing (or defining) **partitions** seems easy, but is easy to get wrong
* Consider the characteristic "**order of elements in list F**"

::: columns
:::: column

$b_1$ = sorted in ascending order

$b_2$ = sorted in descending order

$b_3$ = arbitrary order

\vskip1em

but ... something's fishy

Length 1 : [ 14 ]

The list will be in all three blocks

That is, disjointness is not satisfied

::::
:::: column
**Solution:**

Each characteristic should address just one property

* $C_1$: List F sorted ascending
  - $c_1.b_1 = true$
  - $c_1.b_2 = false$
* $C_2$: List F sorted descending
  - $c_2.b_1 = false$
  - $c_2.b_2 = true$

# Modeling the Input Domain

* **Step 1:** Identify testable **functions**

* **Step 2:** Find all **inputs \& parameters**
  - Move from implementation level to design abstraction level

* **Step 3:** Model the **input domain** -> Produce an *Input Domain Model (IDM)*
  - Entirely at the design abstraction level

* **Step 4:** Apply a test **criterion** to choose **combinations** of values
  - Entirely at the design abstraction level

* **Step 5:** Refine combinations of blocks into **test inputs**
  - Back to the implementation abstraction level

# In Class Exercise

* Pick one of the programs from Chapter 1 (findLast, numZero, etc.)
* Create an IDM for your program
* Take 10 minutes

# Steps 1\&2

**Identifying Functionalities, Parameters, and Characteristics**

* A **creative engineering** step
* **More** characteristics means more tests
* **Interface-based**: Translate parameters to characteristics
* **Candidates** for characteristics:
  - **Preconditions** and **postconditions** (list is not empty)
  - **Relationships** to constants and among variables ($x > 0, x \ne y$)
  - Based on software **behavior** (element is in the set)
* Should **not** use program source--characteristics should be based on the **input domain**
  - Program source should be used with **graph** or **logic** criteria
* Better to have **more characteristics** with **few blocks**
  - Fewer mistakes and fewer tests

# Example IDM Based on Syntax

* Consider method `triang()` form class `TriangleType` in `Triangle.java` on Moodle

\footnotesize
```java
public enum Triangle { Scalene, Isosceles, Equilateral, Invalid }
public static Triangle triang(int Side1, int Side2, int Side3)
// Side1, Side2, and Side3 represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle
//Returns the appropriate enum value
```

##

\large

The IDM for each parameter is identical

\vskip1em

Reasonable characteristic: Relation of side with zero

# Example IDM Based on Behavior

* Again, consider method `triang()` from class `TriangleType`:
  - The three parameters represent a `triangle`
  - The IDM can combine all parameters
  - Reasonable characteristic: **type of triangle**

# In Class Exercise

* **Identify functionalities, parameters, and characteristics for** `findElement()`

\footnotesize
```java
public boolean findElement(List list, Object element)
// Effects: if list or element is null throw NullPointerException
//         else return true if element is in the list, false otherwise
```

# Steps 1\&2--IDM

\footnotesize
```java
public boolean findElement(List list, Object element)
// Effects: if list or element is null throw NullPointerException
//         else return true if element is in the list, false otherwise
```

## Parameters and Characteristics

Two \underline{parameters}: **list, element**

\underline{Characteristics} based on syntax:

* **list** is null (block1 = true, block2 = false)
* **list** is empty (block1 = true, block2 = false)

\underline{Characteristics} based on behavior:

* number of occurrences of **element** in list: (0, 1, >1)
* **element** occurs **first** in list: (true, false)
* **element** occurs **last** in list: (true, false)

# Step 3

**Modeling the Input Domain**

* Partitioning characteristics into blocks and values is a very **creative engineering** step
* **More blocks** means more tests
* Partitioning often flows directly from the definition of **characteristics** and both steps are done together
  - Should **evaluate** them separately -- sometimes fewer characteristics can be used with more blocks and vice versa

# Step 3

**Modeling the Input Domain, cont'd**

* **Strategies** for identifying values:
  - Include **valid**, **invalid** and **special** values
  - **Sub-partition** some blocks
  - Explore **boundaries** of domains
  - Include values that represent "**normal use**"
  - Try to **balance** the number of blocks in each characteristic
  - Check for **completeness** and **disjointness**

# triang() IDM based on Syntax

* `triang()` has one testable function and three integer inputs
