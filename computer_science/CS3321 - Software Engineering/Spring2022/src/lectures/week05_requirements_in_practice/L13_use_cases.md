# Introduction

* \small The Use Case practice is a requirements analysis technique that has been widely used in modern software engineering since its introduction by Ivar Jacobson in 1987.
  - \footnotesize Use Cases can help teams understand the bigger picture and how product backlog items are related.

\vskip0.5em

* \small The following briefly introduces Use Cases leaving the details to other literature and presentations

# Use Cases Explained

* \small A Use Case describes all the ways of using a system to achieve a particular goal for a particular user

* \small How do they compare with User Stories?
  - \footnotesize User stories represent stories (each one is a single scenario or example of a story) of using the system
  - \footnotesize User Stories help flesh out missing requirements by encouraging informal discussion between developers and users, yet:
    * \scriptsize Many User stories... sometimes are too many
    * \scriptsize It is not clear how these user stories make up something complete
    * \scriptsize Lack of structure
  - \footnotesize Epics can help consolidate many stories and provide structure

* \small Use cases give requirements a structure, or a systematic way to organize requirements
  - \footnotesize This structure makes it easier for teams to conduct analysis, user interface (UI) design, service design, implementation, tests, and so on.

# Use Case Models

::: columns
:::: column

* \footnotesize In the UML the relationships between users and use cases are represented in what is referred to as a Use-Case Diagram

\vskip0.5em

* \footnotesize Use cases include the actual functionality and behavior of the system
  - \scriptsize Each use case is described in a text Use-Case Narrative
  - \scriptsize This narrative provides a textual description of the sequence of interactions between the actor and the system
  - \scriptsize It also describes what the system does as a response to each message from the actor

# Use Cases Narrative

* \small The use case narrative is usually separated into two parts, referred to as the \textcolor{Buttons}{\textit{basic flow}} and the \textcolor{Buttons}{\textit{alternate flows}}

\vskip0.5em

* \small The \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{basic flow}} describes a normal or a "basic" use of the described use case and is often called the "happy path scenario"
  - \footnotesize The basic flow is worded in a way you would test and verify the behavior of the functionality
  - \footnotesize It is a sequence of steps you would expect when using or testing the system

\vskip0.5em

* \small The \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{alternate flows}} are variations of the basic flow to deal with more specific cases
  - \footnotesize These variations can be enhancements, special cases, etc.
  - \footnotesize There can be multiple alternate flows

# Use Case Narrative Examples

# Use Case Considerations

1. \small The use cases help you see the big picture through the use-case model

\vskip0.5em

2. \small The use case approach provides structure through the separation of basic and alternate flows
   - \footnotesize This structure also makes the requirements easier to understand, especially on endeavors that are large and complex.

\vskip0.5em

3. \small A use case often contains too much functionality to be developed in one iteration, such as a single sprint when using Scrum.
   - \footnotesize That is why a use case is split up into a number of intelligently selected smaller parts that are referred to as use-case slices.
   - \footnotesize These use-case slices taken together represent the whole use case and when all the use-case slices are described, the whole use case is described

# Use Case Slices

* \small A \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{use-case slice is a slice through a use case that is meaningful to describe, design, implement and test in one go.}}
  - \footnotesize It doesn't need to by itself give value to a user, but together with all other slices of the same use case, the value is achieved.
  - \footnotesize For example, the basic flow of a use case is a good candidate to become an early use-case slice.
  - \footnotesize Additional slices can then be added to complete the whole use case later.

\vskip0.5em

* \small The slicing mechanism enables you to create slices as big or small as you need \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{to drive your development}}.
  - \footnotesize The use-case slices include more than just the requirements.
  - \footnotesize They also slice through all the other aspects of the system (e.g. user experience (user interface), architecture, design, code, test) and its documentation.

# Disclaimer on this Practice

* \small The Use-Case Lite practice that we discuss provides a scalable, agile practice that uses use cases to capture the functionality of a software system and test them to ensure the system fulfills them
  - \footnotesize Use cases provide an approach for putting product backlog items into context from the userâ€™s point of view

\vskip0.5em

* \small It is not our intention in this book to explain why one practice is better than other practices
  - \footnotesize All of the practices we present in this book are example practices.

\vskip0.5em

* \small We want the reader to understand:
  - \footnotesize How they can be represented in an essentialized form
  - \footnotesize What value essentialization brings to comparing practices

# Use Case Essentialized Practice

* How to describe the Use Case Lite Practice using Essence?

\vskip0.5em

* The first questions we always ask when essentializing a practice are:
  - \small What are the things you need to work with?
  - \small What are the activities you do?

# Use Case Practice Essentialized

::: columns
:::: column

* \footnotesize Requirements are decomposed into Use Cases, which in turn are broken down into Use-Case Slices
  - \scriptsize All three are important things we need to work with and progress
  - \scriptsize Alphas represents important things we need to progress

* \footnotesize A Use-Case Model is a tangible description of the Requirements and therefore it is a work product.

* \footnotesize Each use case, within our Use-Case Lite practice, has two related work products:
  1. \scriptsize Use-Case Narrative
     - \tiny Singleton
  2. \scriptsize Use-Case Slice Test Case.
     - \tiny Exists in many instances

# Activities and Use Case Slices

::: columns
:::: column

\small There are four activities in our  Use-Case Lite practice, namely:

1. \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Find Actors and Use Cases}} to gain an overall understanding of what the system is about.

\vskip0.25em

2. \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Slice the Use Cases}} to break them up into a number of intelligently selected smaller slices that each fit within a single sprint. Such a slice is a Use-Case Slice.

\vskip0.25em

3. \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Prepare a Use-Case Slice}} by enhancing the narrative and test cases to clearly define what it means to successfully implement the slice.

\vskip0.25em

4. \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Test a Use-Case Slice}} to verify it is done and ready for inclusion in a release

::::
:::: column

* \footnotesize Use-case \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{slices are identified}} by working through their use case to identify paths, scenarios or as we say the stories that build up the use case.

\vskip0.25em

* \footnotesize Typically a \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{\textit{story} is any path that you may want to follow}} going through the use case its basic flow or its alternative flows.

\vskip0.25em

* \footnotesize The \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{story idea is similar to the user story idea in the User Story practice}} and is very important to find good use-case slices.

\vskip0.25em

* \footnotesize A \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{use-case slice typically includes one or more stories}}.

# Test Use-Case Slice Activity

::: columns
:::: {.column width=.667}

* \small The goal of the Test a Use-Case Slice activity is to verify that the slice is done and ready for inclusion in a release

\vskip.5em

* \small The Use-Case Slice test cases chosen in previous slides are input to this activity.

\vskip.5em

* \small During testing, these test cases are refined further with additional details to make sure that they are repeatable

# Impact of Use Cases for the Team

* \small Use cases helps the team found they could see the big picture of the system better through their use case diagrams and use case model

\vskip.5em

* \small This is made visible by looking at the Use Case Liteâ€™s coverage of the solution activity spaces

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{images/UseCases/slide28.eps}
\end{center}

# Monitoring the Project Progress

* \small Teams work with multiple use-case slices from multiple use cases at any point in time.

\vskip0.5em

* \small They complete use-case slices within each sprint
  - \footnotesize i.e. drive them to the Use-Case Slice Verified state.

\vskip0.5em

* \small While individual use-case slices are completed in each sprint, often it requires multiple sprints to complete a full use case.

\vskip1em

* \small How to monitor the progress and health of Use Cases and Use Cases Slices?
  - \footnotesize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{The alpha state cards for Use Case and Use-Case Slices provide a tool for this purpose}}

# Example Project and the Other Practices

\small
\begin{center}
\textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{\textit{TravelEssence}}} team has chosen multiple practices: Therefore, they have a number of alphas to juggle
\end{center}

From the \textcolor{Buttons}{\textbf{Scrum Lite practice}}

* \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Sprint}} -- focusing on the goals for the Sprint
* \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Product Backlog Item}} -- a change to be made to the product in a future release

\small From the \textcolor{Buttons}{\textbf{Use-Case Lite practice}}

* \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Use-Case Slices}} -- the UC Slices to be Verified by the end of the Sprint
* \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Use Cases}} -- they need not be completed for each sprint, but they are useful for determining which use-case slices should be implemented first.
  - \tiny Thus, different use cases will be at different states at the end of each sprint.

\small From the \textcolor{Buttons}{\textbf{Essence kernel}}

* \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Work}} -- the team needs to maintain the Under Control state as development progresses.
* \scriptsize \textcolor{Roarange}{\textbf{Requirements}} -- the Requirements alpha progresses towards Addressed or Fulfilled depending on the goals of the sprint
