# Team Dynamics

* A key to a great team project, is a great team
* Yet, these things don't happen by accident
* Typically, when forging a team or adding new members we look at how they interact with current team members
  - Normally a part of the interview process
* Unfortunately, that is not going to be the case here

# Team Dynamics

* Your teams will start out as a random group of students
* It should be your goals to:
  1. Get to know each other personally (if you don't already), in a setting outside of class
  2. Get to know each other's strengths (technically)
  3. Get to know each other's weaknesses (technically)
  4. Start to create a "Jelled" team

# Creating a "Jelled" Team

* A team of people so strongly knit that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts

\vskip1em

* Characteristics of a jelled team:

  * Very low turnover rate
  * Strong sense of identity
  * A feeling of eliteness
  * Team vs. individual ownership of the project
  * Team members enjoy their work

# Motivating People

* Motivation is the greatest influence on performance
* Monetary rewards usually do not motivate
* Suggested motivating techniques:

  * 20% time rule
  * Peer-to-peer recognition awards
  * Team ownership (refer to the team as "we")
  * Allow members to focus on what interests them
  * Utilize equitable compensation
  * Encourage group ownership
  * Provide for autonomy, but trust the team to deliver

# Handling Conflict

* Preventing or mitigating conflict:

  * Cohesiveness has the greatest effect
  * Clearly defining roles and holding team members accountable
  * Establish work & communications rules in the project charter

* Additional techniques:

  * Clearly define plans for the project
  * Make sure the team understands the importance of the project
  * Develop detailed operating procedures
  * Develop a project charter
  * Develop a schedule of commitments in advance
  * Forecast other priorities and their impact on the project

# Other Difficulties

* This project will require time and planning
* It will also require that you and your team work together to ensure the work is done and is of high quality
* This means that as a team you need to:
  - Hold regularly scheduled meetings
  - Assign jobs to one another, and hold each other accountable for those assignments
  - Utilize technologies such as Zoom, Slack or Discord, and GitHub to coordinate your project

# Project Grading

* \small The project is divided into 5 Parts
  - \scriptsize Week 06: Project Setup (5%)
  - \scriptsize Weeks 07 - 08: Sprint 01 (20%)
  - \scriptsize Weeks 09 - 10: Sprint 02 (20%)
  - \scriptsize Weeks 11 - 12: Sprint 03 (20%)
  - \scriptsize Weeks 13 - 14: Sprint 04 (20%)
  - \scriptsize Week 15: Project Presentation (10%)
  - \scriptsize Peer Evaluations (5%)

* \small The team will receive a grade value, but the individual score for each team member will be weighted by a multiplier.
  - \scriptsize This multiplier will be derived from the feedback reports submitted after each part
  - \scriptsize Thus, as a team you may have done well, but individually you can still fail.
  - \scriptsize This acts a means to ensure accountability of each team member to the team.
