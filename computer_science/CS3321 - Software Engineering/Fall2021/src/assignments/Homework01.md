# Homework 01

- Consider the following software system: A University Course Catalog System

  - Identify the stakeholders of this system (both internal and external)
  - Select at least two stakeholders (general groups) and describe their interests and concerns

- Compare and contrast structured and component methods and their characteristics:

  - As part of your narrative, describe the relationship between the general notions of methods and practices
  - Using this relationship as a basis provide examples of practices for both methods as the basis for your comparison

- You are going to be working in teams this semester. From your previous experience and from what you have already learned this semester discuss team work while answering the following questions:

  - When forming a team is there an expectation of a baseline set of capabilities for each team member?
  - If so, what are these capabilities and how does this background affect the nature of the identified practices (i.e., more explicit or more tacit) used by the team?
  - How does the capabilities of each team member affect the dynamics of the team as a whole and the software engineering endeavor.

I would suggest considering this question in the context of an example.

- Consider the concept of requirements: Identify how requirements play a mediating role between software engineers, stakeholders, and the system. As you are thinking about this consider the requirements alpha: how do the alpha states associated relate to this role that requirements plays.

- Consider just the `Software System` alpha. Identify the activity spaces which affect this alpha and describe how each of these would push progress forward and transition the alpha from one state to another.

- Identify what the expectations of software engineering theory are, and once identified present at least one argument for why theory is needed in software engineering.
