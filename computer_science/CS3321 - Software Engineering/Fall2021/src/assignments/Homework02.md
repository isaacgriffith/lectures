# Homework 02

1. In Scrum, during the daily scrum meeting the Product Owner is only allowed to ask the developers the same three questions. What are these questions? What two additional questions might you want to ask? For each, explain its benefit toward achieving the goals of the meeting.

2. During this course you and your team will be working on an endeavor. Towards this, you will need to define your teams' method. From the perspective of a Essence, what is the concept of a method. And, what is the method you and your team have agreed to use for your project. Please describe in as much detail as needed.

3. Construct a set of user stories for the MVP of a game of blackjack for a virtual casino. Assume there is a dealer, a single player, and the ability to make bets. As part of your user stories, include the associated acceptance tests. For each story created, the expected level of detail is: Acceptance Criteria Listed. Once you have the initial user stories defined, refine them into what would be able to be completed in a two week sprint. Through your refinement, identify any epics that may exist.

4. Using the user stories created in #3 above, construct a set of Use Cases capturing the details of each user story. The expected level of detail for any Use-Case narrative you define is "Bulleted Outline". Once you have completed the initial use cases, estimate the time required to implement these use cases. For any use case that would take longer than a two-week sprint to complete, extract use case slices for that use case. Finally, once you have complete this work, construct a Use Case model using Lucid Charts or another UML modeling tool, to show how your use-cases and actors relate.

5. Now consider how we might implement the described BlackJack system using a microservice approach. Using UML (as described in the book), design the necessary components and interfaces needed. As you finalize the design, create a table for each component (service) noting the following information: Path, HTTP method, Data Format, Data to be sent/received.
