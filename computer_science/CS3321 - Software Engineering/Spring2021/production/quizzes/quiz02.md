1. Matching: Match the following terms to their definitions.
   - Development team - A self-organizing group of software developers, which should be no more than 7 people. They are responsible for developing the software and other essential project documents.
   - Potentially shippable - The software increment that is delivered from a sprint. The idea is that this product increment should be ‘potentially shippable’ which means that it is in a finished state and no further work, such as testing, is needed to  incorporate it into the final product. In practice, this is not always achievable.
   - Product backlog - This is a list of ‘to do’ items which the Scrum team must tackle. They may be feature definitions for the software, software requirements, user stories or descriptions of supplementary tasks that are needed, such as architecture definition or user documentation.
   - Product owner - An individual (or possibly a small group) whose job is to identify product features or requirements, prioritize these for development and continuously review the product backlog to ensure that the project continues to meet critical business needs. The Product Owner can be a customer but might also be a product manager in a software company or other stakeholder representative.
   - Scrum - A daily meeting of the Scrum team that reviews progress and prioritizes work to be done that day. Ideally, this should be a short face-to-face meeting that includes the whole team.
   - ScrumMaster - The ScrumMaster is responsible for ensuring that the Scrum process is followed and guides the team in the effective use of Scrum. He or she is responsible for interfacing with the rest of the company and for ensuring that the Scrum team is not diverted by outside interference. The Scrum developers are adamant that the ScrumMaster should not be thought of as a project manager. Others, however, may not always find it easy to see the difference.
   - Sprint - A development iteration. Sprints are usually 2-4 weeks long.
   - Velocity - An estimate of how much product backlog effort that a team can cover in a single sprint.  Understanding a team’s velocity helps them estimate what can be covered in a sprint and provides a basis for measuring improving performance.

2. True or False: During a sprint customer's can submit change requests to add new stories to the product backlog.
   - True
 
3. Which of the following is **not** a benefit of the Scrum approach?
   - The product is borken down into a set of manageable and understandable chunks
   - Unstable requirements do not hold up progress
   - The whole team has visibility of everything and consequently team communication is improved
   - **Customers see on-time deliveries but have little chance to provide feedback on how the product works**
   - Trust between cusomers and developers is established and a positive culture is created in which everyone expects the project to succeed.
   - None of the other choices

4. Which of the following represents the standard process for the agile planning game?
   - **Story Identification -> Initial Estimation -> Release Planning -> Loop(Iteration Planning -> Task Planning)**
   - Initial Estimation -> Story Identification -> Release Planning -> Loop(Iteration Planning)
   - Release Planning -> Story Identification -> Initial Estimation -> Loop(Iteration Planning -> Task Planning)**
   - Story Identification -> Initial Estimation -> Release Planning -> Loop(Task Planning -> Iteration Planning)
   
5. Estimation accuracy increases as we approach:
   - Feasibility
   - Requirements
   - Design
   - Code
   - **Delivery**
   
6. COCOMO is what?
   - An agile software development process similar to Scrum or XP
   - A plan driven software development process similar to the incremental process
   - A project estimation technique based on software project manager experience and expertise
   - **A project estimation technique relying upon empirical and mathematical modeling**
   
7. The system **shall** function correctly 90% of the time for 2 hours or more on a regular 2700 mAh NiMH battery.
   - This represents a user requirement
   - **This represents a system requirement**
   - This represents a functional requirement
   - **This represents a non-functional requirement**
   
8. The system shall allow an attribute to be entered in the CMS that references the patient release form that must be on file before a testimonial or quote is displayed on the website in the form of a checkbox that states "Yes, I have the patient release form and have sent it to my communications partner."
   - This represents a user requirement
   - **This represents a system requirement**
   - **This represents a functional requirement**
   - This represents a non-functional requirement
   
9. Which of the following are the steps in the requirements elicitation and analysis process?
   - **Requirements Discovery**
   - **Classification and Organization**
   - **Prioritization and Negotiation**
   - **Requirements Specification**
   - Stakeholder Interviewing
   - Prototype Evaluation
   
10. Matching, match the following requirements specification notation forms to their associated descriptions.
   - Natural Language
     - the requirements are written using numbered stentences in natural language. Each sentence should express one requirment.
   - Structured Natural Language
     - The requriements are written in natural language on a stanadrd form or template. Each field provides information about an aspect of the requirement.
   - Design description languages
     - This approach uses a language like a programming language, but with more abstract features to specify the requirements by defining an operational model of the system. This approach is now rarely used although it can be useful for interface specifications.
   - Graphical notations
     - Graphical models, supplemented by text annotations, are used to define the functional requirements for the system; UML use case and sequence diagrams are commonly used.
   - Mathematical specifications
     - These notations are based on mathematical concepts such as finite-state machines or sets. Althrough these unambiguous specificatiosn can reduce the ambiguity in a requirements document, most customers don't understand a formal specification. They cannot check that it represents what they want and are reluctant to accept it as a system contract.
