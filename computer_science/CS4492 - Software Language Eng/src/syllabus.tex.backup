\section*{Course Evaluation and Expectations}
This course will be fast paced and will require the students to manage their time effectively. The course evaluation is divided into three components: In Labs, Out Labs and Exams. The In Labs are small programming assignments designed to help the student learn concepts through experience. The Out Labs are meant to be a more extensive assignment to help the student learn and apply the concepts from class. Finally, the examinations are designed to help the students evaluate their level of knowledge and for the instructor to evaluate the class overall.

\begin{itemize}
\item In Lab Assignments (evenly weighted) -- 20\%
\item Out Lab Assignments (evenly weighted) -- 55\%
\item Exam 1 -- 10\%
\item Exam 2 -- 15\%
\end{itemize}
\newpage
To pass the course, you must average at least 50\% on the exams. The final will not be given early. At the end of the session, grades will be determined (after any curving takes place) based on your class average as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\begin{multicols}{3}
\item 93+: A
\item 90+: A-
\item 87+: B+
\item 83+: B
\item 80+: B-
\item 77+: C+
\item 73+: C
\item 70+: C-
\item 67+: D+
\item 63+: D
\item 60+: D-
\item <60: F
\end{multicols}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Late Policy}
If you submit an assignment late (without approval from your instructor) you receive a 0.

\section*{Exams}
There will be two 50 minute exams, one every 3 weeks, over this 6 week course. As the course proceeds the exams will be weighted more heavily. Note that the exams will focus more on the conceptual and theoretical knowledge from this class while the In Labs and Out Labs will focus on the evaluation of programming skill.

\section*{D2L}
Desire 2 Learn (D2L), which can be accessed at \url{http://ecat.montana.edu}, is an online learning tool which we will be using to provide lectures, supplementary information, and for tracking student progress in the course. All assignments are to be submitted to D2L via an associated dropbox for the assignment.

\section*{Collaboration Policy}
You \textit{may} (unless otherwise noted)
\begin{itemize}
  \item Share ideas with other people.
  \item Help other people debug their programs.
\end{itemize}

\noindent You may \textit{NOT}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Share code with other people.
  \item Submit code that you did not write.
  \item Modify someone else's solution and claim it as your own, excluding code derived from the book as directed by your instructor.
  \item Use any outside sources (books, notes, electronic devices, other people) on the midterm or final exam, unless otherwise noted.
\end{itemize}

Failure to abide by these rules will result in everyone involved being reported to the Dean of Students and receiving an F for the course.

\section*{Policy on Class Attendance}

A large amount of material will be covered in a relatively limited amount of time. In addition, a fairly large amount of work will be done by the student. Consequently, class attendance is strongly recommended but is not required.

\section*{Policy on Cell Phones, Laptops, and Tablets}

Bringing your personal phones, tables or laptops to class is fine. I do require that you set your phones to at least silent, and mute any sounds from either your tablet or laptop. Also refrain from replying or sending texts, social media, or phone calls during class, if you feel that you must do this then please leave the class and take care of it in the hallway. Further, playing games in class will also not be tolerated. The distractions that these actions cause both for your classmates as well as for your instructor are taxing on the limited time we have. If you are found to be performing any of these actions you will be asked to leave the classroom for the day.
