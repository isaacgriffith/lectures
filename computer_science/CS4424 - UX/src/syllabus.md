# Technology

This is a Software Engineering course and thus will heavily rely upon the use of current technology. As a student you are expected to have at your disposal a computer system capable of running a recent operating system such as MacOS X, Windows 10, or Linux. In addition, you will be required to use Git, a professional grade IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) and build system. Furthermore, you, as a future technologist, are responsible for installing and learning to use these tools.

# Learning Outcomes

The following outcomes will be evaluated via homework assignments and exams


The following outcomes will be evaluated via the course project

\sepline

# Student Expectations

The above objectives cannot be met unless you, the student, take an active role in your education. Thus you are expected to:

* **Attend class** on a regular basis and devote your attention to the material presented
* **I expect students to be on time to class. Towards that I will lock the doors at the start of each class.**
* Prepare for each and every class by **reading** the assigned material and completing both **pre- and post-lecture assignments**
* Devote the necessary **time** to preparing assignments and turning them in on time.
    * **Computer Science** is time-intensive
    * You should be prepared to give the time need for each assignment
    * As the class progresses the time required for assignments will increase, be prepared.
* **Time Management** is a requirement. Do not procrastinate, as the amount of time required for any given assignment and any given student cannot be estimated. For this reason you are encourage to begin assignments at the earliest possible date so that you will be able to complete them on time.

This is a 3 credit course junior level course, as a student, you should expect to put forth on average 6 -- 9 hours of additional effort outside the classroom towards this course. Given that, I expect to utilize this completely.

\sepline

# Moodle

Course material including lectures, assignment requirements, handouts, and solutions can be viewed using your Moodle account. Announcement and Help forums will also be available on Moodle. Students are expected to access their Moodle account on a daily basis to keep apprised of course developments.

\sepline

# Assignments

Homework assignments are due as assigned on Moodle. Do the homework, it helps. Late homework will not be accepted and will incur a 0 grade.

This course is based upon four components:

* Attendance at lectures and participation during in class exercises.
* Reading assignments
* Project
* Exams

\sepline

# Project

A significant portion of your final grade is based on the group project. This project consists of the application of software engineering principles and processes to the development of a product. Teams will be assigned at random at the beginning of the third week of the course. Team members will not be reassigned during the course. Note that your grade on the project is a direct result of the team functioning as a unit and on the satisfactory completion of each of the deliverables. The end results of the project consist of a document describing the design of the system and an implementation of the system. Each team member is required to work on all components of the project which includes, but is not limited to:

* Project documentation
* Project presentation
* Project code
* Project testing
* Project management
* Project requirements engineering

A failure to participate in each of these will result in a significant deviation of your individual grade from the team's project grade.

## Individual Project Multiplier

Individual team member final project grades will be modified from the team project grade by a multiplier. The value of this multiplier ranges between 0.0 and 1.0. This value is determined by an aggregation of peer evaluations, observations by your instructor, and participation in project activities as evidenced on git, attendance at meetings, etc. Thus, it is possible that your team scores perfectly on the project but you still receive a failing grade for the project.

\sepline

# Exams

You will be tested on your mastery of topics listed above as taken from lecture, readings, and assignments. Any information addressed by a component of this class will be considered for exams. There will be two exams, a mid-term and a final. The **final** will be a **comprehensive** exam.


**Note:** If you do not earned a **60% or higher average** on the exams in this course the highest grade you will receive in this course is a **60%** which equates to a **D--**

\sepline

# Grade Distribution

Grades for all assignments, exams, and the final grade will be assigned according to the following table:

+-----------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| **Grade** | **--**         |                | **+**          |

# Policies & Procedures

## Academic Integrity

**Academic Integrity** is expected at Idaho State University and both the College of Business and the College of Science and Engineering. All forms of academic dishonesty, including cheating and plagiarism, are strictly prohibited, the penalties for which range up to permanent expulsion from the university with “Expulsion for Academic Dishonesty” noted on the student’s transcript. %If you are unclear as to what constitutes academic dishonesty, you can get a copy of the College of Business Policy on Academic Integrity from the College of Business office in BA 202, or from the College of Business website at www.cob.isu.edu, or refer to the ISU Faculty/Staff Handbook policy on academic dishonesty at: http://www.isu.edu/policy/fs-handbook/part6/6_9/6_9a.html or http://www.isu.edu/library/research/ait/aitsitemap.html.


Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to:

1. Cheating on Exams
2. Plagiarism
3. Collusion


**Definitions**

**Cheating** on an examination include:

* Copying from anther's paper, any means of communication with another during an exam, giving aid to or receiving aid from another during an exam;
* Using any material during an examination that is unauthorized by the proctor;
* Taking or attempting to take an exam for another student or allowing another student to take or attempt to take an exam for oneself
* Using, obtaining, or attempting to obtain by any means the whole or any part of an administered exam.
* Talking to anyone other than the professor during an exam.

**Plagiarism** is the unacknowledged incorporation of another student's work into work which the student offers for credit.

**Collusion** is the unauthorized collaboration of another in preparing work that a student offers for credit.

**Other types** of academic dishonesty include:

* Using other student's content from their assignments, disk, etc.
* Performing any act designed to give unfair advantage to a student or the attempt to commit such acts

**Notes:**

* The use of the source code of another person's program, even temporarily, is considered plagiarism.
* Copying material from a source without attributing (citing) the source
* Allowing another person to use your source code, even temporarily, is considered collusion

In this course, the specific exceptions given below are not considered scholastically dishonest acts:

* Discussion of the algorithm and general programming techniques used to solve a problem.
* Giving and receiving aid in debugging.
* Discussion and comparison of program output **(output only not code)**

Academic Integrity violations are a scourge at any University. I detest them with a passion. Anyone found to be violating the academic integrity code on any assignment or exam will be dealt with with extreme prejudice. The standard remedy, in this course, **for any Academic Integrity Violation will be FAILURE of the course**. Please note that in accordance with the Policy at Idaho State University that attempts to withdraw from the course to avoid such punishment will work to no avail.

## Student Notification
All students are responsible for checking the web page and their email on a regular basis, preferably daily, for notification of any class scheduling changes or assignment clarification. Notice of quizzes or assignment clarifications may be posted late at night.

## Instructor Availability
The instructor will be available during posed office hours, but additional efforts are made to increase accessibility to the students. If the instructor is not available at the telephone number above, the student can leave a detailed voicemail message. However, the instructor's email is check throughout the day and often the student will get an immediate response to questions submitted by email. Email is usually the most reliable means of contact.

Note that I am a working research scientist, thus I may need to attend conferences both with my local colleagues and with my international colleagues. Thus, I am constantly in meetings, both here and abroad. That being said, I work 7 days a week 12 months a year. If you need my help and all other means of scheduling have led to no avail, please do not hesitate to contact me. Note that I am not an emergency service, I will require that you contact me 24 hours prior to an assignment being due, for which you need help. If you do not plan ahead, I cannot help.

## Email Etiquette
Email is the best possible method of reaching me outside of my office hours. Note that I have certain expectations for communicating with me via email, as follows:

* DO NOT use chat or SMS shorthand in your messages.
* Use full words, and full sentences.
* Maintain the frame of mind that your are communicating to a professional, and that a professional demeanor is required.

Failure to abide by these requirements will result in your email being deleted and forgotten.

## Disability and Special Needs
The Computer Science program at Idaho State University is committed to ensuring that all students achieve their potential. If you have a disability (physical, hearing, vision, psychiatric, or learning disability) that may need a reasonable accommodation, please contact the ADA & Disabilities Resource Center located in the Rendezvous Complex, Room 125, 282-3599, as early as possible.

## Closed Week Policy
Information about the ISU Closed Week Policy can be found online. Note that the policy does not prevent the presentation of new material during closed week.

## CoSE X Grade Policy
In the College of Science and Engineering, a student who earns a failing grade via course work (exams, homework, etc.) and has unexcused absences that total more than 30% of class meetings will receive a grade of "X".
