!question{4}{
I appreciate a well organized gear room with a bin for fishing gear (one half for fly, other for spin), camping gear (summer bag and tent, winter bag and tent, ultralight bag and tent), parts (ski, fishing, bike, ...), ... Believe me, it keeps going on. What sort of data structure should represent the gear room that would best aid me in locating a specific thing I am looking for?
