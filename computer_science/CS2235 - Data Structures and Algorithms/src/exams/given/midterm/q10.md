!question{4}{
I am developing a simulation for Delta Airlines, which simulates the planing and de-planing of passengers from an airplane. At present, I am concerned with modeling the most basic method of people leaving a plane. In the most basic form, passengers enqueue and dequeue from the front. Which data structure would best represent this approach?
