!question{4}{
I have decided that the whole professor thing is far too much work, and have decided that I need to change careers towards delivering packages. Assuming that I have up front knowledge of where items are to be delivered, and have calculated the optimal route, and I load the truck from back to front (closer to the driver) for optimal package delivery. What data structure would I use to represent the ordering of packages in the truck?
