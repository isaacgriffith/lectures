!question{4}
I am currently employed by a company working on what they believe is the next generation of web browser. But, just like every web browser it needs a component to represent the history of the user's browsing. This means that the user's current view (from any one tab) can change backwards and forwards based on pages they have visited in their recent history. What underlying data structure would best represent this feature?
