!question{4}{
I am building an application that allows for the collaborative estimation of size for a user story. To do this, each software engineer gets one bid and then it moves on to the next in round-robin fashion. The app needs to be designed for teams of varying sizes. Which data structure should I use to best represent the bidding process?
