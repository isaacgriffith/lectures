!question{4}{
I am currently developing a simulation for Delta Airlines to model the planing and de-planing of passengers at the airport. At this point I am interested in modeling the optimal (as in fastest) approach for loading and unloading. Which data structure would be best to model the plane (computationally), if passengers are able to enter and leave from the front and back of the plane?
