!question{4}{
I am writing a printer management system for the College of Science and engineering. for any one printer/copier the print jobs that come in are ordered both by time of arrival and by who submitted the job. In the latter case, faculty come first followed by graduate students followed by undergraduate students, but everyone is preempted by a person making a copy at the machine itself. What data structure should I use to handle this situation?
