!question{4}{

I am interested in building a quick-and-dirty web crawler which simply extracts every work (except stop words such as "a, an, the, by, be, ...") which occur on each web page visited. I then want to store these words such that for each unique word I want to know which sites that it appears on. Which of the following data structures would be best suited for this task?

!choices{
 !choice Set
 !choice MultiSet
 !correct MultiMap
 !choice Map
}
}
