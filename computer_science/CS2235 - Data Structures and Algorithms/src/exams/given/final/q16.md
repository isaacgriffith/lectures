Which of the following best describes the greedy algorithm design strategy?

!choices{
 !choice The problem is divided into smaller versions of the problem until they can be immediately computed, the solution is then built by aggregating these small solutions into the whole.
 !choice The problem is divided into smaller subproblems whose answer is stored for later use or when the same subproblem is seen. The larger problem is solved by selecting the optimal solution from the aggregation of the subproblems.
 !correct The problem is solved optimally in the global sense by selecting locally optimal choices at each stage of the problem.
