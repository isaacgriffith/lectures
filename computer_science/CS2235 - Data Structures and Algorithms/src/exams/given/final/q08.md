The following narrative describes an operation on one of the data structures we studied. Please select which data structure and operation is describe, as follows:

Given an item i, search the structure until either i is found, or null is reached. If null is reached, then we can add i to the structure. We then set the value for the level to be i and we randomly flip a coin, until "tails" is seen, each time heads is seen we add i into "level" and then increment level.
