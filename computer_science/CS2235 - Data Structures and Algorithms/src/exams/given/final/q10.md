!question{4}{

We use variable length codes in Huffman coding to optimize the compression of the encoded data. What property of these prefix free codes makes it so that Huffman coding actually works?

!choices{
 !choice We don't actually use prefix free codes in Huffman Coding
 !choice They are uniquely decipherable since each code is of the same length.
 !correct They are uniquely decipherable since no code is a prefix of another.
 !choice Huffman coding doesn't produce optimal encoding of the data.
