!question{4}{

If I am determining whether to use a Heap or an OrderedList as the basis of a PriorityQueue, we know that the difference lies in the fact that for a Heap both `offer` and `poll` are O(log n) but in an OrderedList `offer` is O(n), while `poll` is O(1). What are does this mean.

!choices{
 !choice If I am offering seldom, and polling often, I should choose the heap.
 !choice The Ordered List is much faster when offering data, so just use it always.
 !correct If I will be offering often, but polling seldom, I should choose to use a Heap.
 !choice The Heap is best for small amounts of data.
