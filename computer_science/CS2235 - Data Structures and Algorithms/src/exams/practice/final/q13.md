Lets say that we have a priority Queue which we are using to sort people by their age prior to gaining access to a prize drawing.  We have the following people:

Larry, 22

Sara, 19

Bob, 5

Qing, 98

Lowell, 18

Sunshine, .5

Assuming that we use a Max-Heap as the basis of the Queue (and their ages are a value in years). After offering each individual to the Priority Queue, and we perform the following operations:

1 peek, 3 polls, 1 peek, 1 poll, then offer the following individuals:

Ginny, 13

Lora, 8

Then perform an additional peek, who is the person on top of the Queue?
