!question{4}{

I am currently designing a simple text-based dungeon game. At any point in the game a player has a choice on the direction they wish to go. Not all directions are available in every room of the dungeon. Furthermore, some rooms, preclude the ability to go back the way you came or even lock the door after you enter. What data structure would you select to optimally represent the order of the path a player has taken through the dungeon?

!choices{
 !choice Tree
 !choice DAG
 !correct Stack
 !choice Queue
}
}
