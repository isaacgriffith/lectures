!question{4}{

If I am determining whether to use a Heap or an LinkedList as the basis of a PriorityQueue, we know that the difference lies in the fact that for a Heap both `offer` and `poll` are O(log n) but in an LinkedList `offer` is O(1), while `poll` is O(n). What are does this mean.

!choices{
 !choice If I am offering seldom, and polling often, I should choose the heap.
 !choice The Linked List is much faster when offering data, so just use it always.
 !correct If I will be offering seldom, but polling often, I should choose to use a Heap.
 !choice The Heap is best for small amounts of data.
