!question{4}{

If the load factor in a hash table grows too large, the operation overhead also increases, leading to poor performance. One strategy we have to reduce loading is to resize the table. Why does this strategy work?

!choices{
 !choice This actually does nothing.
 !choice decreases the number of entries in the tables which in turn reduces the load factor.
 !correct Increases the number of buckets and thus reduces the load factor.
 !choice Splits out the entries and reduces clusters.
}
}
