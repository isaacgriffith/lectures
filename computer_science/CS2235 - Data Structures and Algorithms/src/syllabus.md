    description: |
        Implementation, usage, and design concerns of important data structures and their operations. Implementation and discussion of basic search and sorting algorithms. Discussion will include both O(n log n) and linear sorting algorithms. Incorporates aspects of time complexity and asymptotic analysis of algorithms. Students will be required to develop small to medium sized programs.
