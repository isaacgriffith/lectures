# Grading (50 Points)

1. You will need gradle installed to evaluate their projects.
2. The algorithms are evaluated by executing the following command in the root directory of their project: `$ gradle test`
   - For each test that fails use the grading point value below to assess
3. The remainder of this section is based on their writeup.
   - 15 points: Their writeup is well written (contains paragraphs, minimal grammatical mistakes, and generally readable) presentation of a logical and sound description of the results of executing the algorithms. They should have included a chart depicting the results of their experiment and an analysis of these results discussing what they found and comparing their results of the algorithms.
     * 5 Points for the readability of the writeup
     * 5 Points for the writeup of the experiment
     * 5 Points for the discussion of the results
   - Note if they do not put their name at the top of the writeup, they lose 15 points for the writeup.
