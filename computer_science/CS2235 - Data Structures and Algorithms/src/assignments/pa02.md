# Purpose {-}

* To explore the construction of List Structures
* To explore the use of List Structures in an application

# Problem Statement {-}

We need to design a scoreboard to store highscores for a video game. You are given the classes which represent a score, called `GameEntry`, and the `Scoreboard`. Each game entry simply contains the score associated with a player's name. The scoreboard maintains a list of scores which has a maximum capacity that can be saved. It is your job to implement the underlying data structure which will be used to store each score. In this case we will be implementing list structures to store the scores. Each list will need to implement, and conform to, a provided interface called `List`. The capacity constraint will be a part of the `Scoreboard` class and will be handled within that classes methods.

To get you started a gradle project has been created. Within the source directly you will find two main packages: `edu.isu.cs2235.structures` and `edu.isu.cs2235.structures.impl`. The former package is the location of the interface `List` and the latter is the location for the implementation `SinglyLinkedList` and `DoublyLinkedList`. Outside of these packages are three other files `Driver.java` which contains the executable `main` method for the program; `GameEntry.java` which contains the `GameEntry` class; and `Scoreboard.java` which contains the `Scoreboard` class. You will need to fill in the method bodies for the `add` and `remove` methods of the `Scoreboard` class. I leave the complete implementation of the `SinglyLinkedList` and `DoublyLinkedList` up to you.

# Assignment {-}

1. Build a generic SinglyLinkedList class which implements the `List<E>` interface, found in package `edu.isu.cs2235.structures` in a class called `SinglyLinkedList<E>` in the new package `edu.isu.cs2235.structures.impl`. This class must have the following methods:
   - `public E first()`
   - `public E last()`
   - `public void addLast(E element)`
   - `public void addFirst(E element)`
   - `public E removeFirst()`
   - `public E removeLast()`
   - `public void insert(E element, int index)`
   - `public E remove(int index)`
   - `public E get(int index)`
   - `public int size()`
   - `public boolean isEmpty()`
   - `public void printList()`

2. Build a generic DoublyLinkedList class which implements the `List<E>` interface, found in package `edu.isu.cs2235.structures`, in a class called `DoublyLinkedList<E>` in the new package `edu.isu.cs2235.structures.impl`. This class must have the following methods:
   - `public E first()`
   - `public E last()`
   - `public void addLast(E element)`
   - `public void addFirst(E element)`
   - `public E removeFirst()`
   - `public E removeLast()`
   - `public void insert(E element, int index)`
   - `public E remove(int index)`
   - `public E get(int index)`
   - `public int size()`
   - `public boolean isEmpty()`
   - `public void printList()`

3. In the `Scoreboard` class there are three methods `add(GameEntry entry)` and `remove(int index)` which are required to be implemented. Look at the associated documentation comments to understand the requirements. Note that the `add` method must meet the following requirements:
   - Adds items up to a maximum capacity (as stored in the `Scoreboard` `capacity` field).
   - Items are added in descending order based on the `score` field of the `GameEntry` class.

4. Associated with each class are a set of unit tests. You should execute the unit tests for each component in order to ensure that you have correctly completed the assignment.


**To understand the requirements for each method look at the documentation in the** `edu.isu.cs2235.structures.List` **interface**. You must ensure that each of the requirements for each method are correctly implemented.

Your implementation of Scoreboard will need to use one of the two lists, I leave the selection of the type up to you.

# Submission {-}

When you have completed the assignment (all tests pass) or it is reaching midnight of the due date, make sure you have completed the following:

0. Your code compiles with no compilation errors
1. Zip your entire project directory into a file named \[firstname\]\_\[lastname\].zip (Note that the square brackets are not part of the file name but simply indicate required information)
2. Submit the zip file to moodle in the PA02 dropbox.

# Hints {-}

* The basic implementation of the Singly and Doubly linked lists are defined in the book in Chapter 3. I would consult this prior to beginning implementation.
* The basic implementation (using arrays) for the Scoreboard add() and remove() methods are depicted in the code fragments 3.3 and 3.4 in the book. Use only as a reference but not as an implementation guideline.
