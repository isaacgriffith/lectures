# Practice

* Working in pairs:
  - Create a simple class to act as a calculator:
  - It must be able to add, subtract, divide, and multiply.
  - Probably should use a stack to keep track of provided values and current result.
  - Either Implement the tests and then the calculator, or Implement the calculator then the tests.
