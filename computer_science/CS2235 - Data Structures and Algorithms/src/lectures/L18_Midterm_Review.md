**Module 1**

* Java

# Java

- Understand the inheritance relationship
- Understand how polymorphism works
- Understand how abstraction works
  * Including abstract methods
- Understand how interface realization works

# Big-O Analysis

- Given a code fragment be able to identify the asymptotic class it is in.
- Be able to show that a given function is in/not in a specified complexity class

# Recursion

- Understand the basic formula for constructing a recursive function
- Understand the consequences of a poorly defined recursive function (i.e., when the input does not reduce to the base case).

# Sorting

- Know the Big-O values for best case and worst case for the following algorithms
  * QuickSort
  * MergeSort
  * HeapSort
  * InsertionSort
  * SelectionSort
- Be capable of comparing different algorithms based on their Big-O values

# Searching

- Know how BinarySearch and LinearSearch work
- Given an input, identify exactly how many iterations/recursive calls it will take to find a value
- Know the complexity of both BinarySearch and LinearSearch, when applied to an Array or LinkedList

# Linked Lists

- For each of the following operations on an SLL, DLL, or CLL know the complexity class:
  * get(ndx)
  * first()
  * last()
  * insert(ndx)
  * remove(ndx)
  * removeFirst()
  * removeLast()
- Know the properties of each type of ADT such that if given a problem statement you would know which type to use.

# Stacks and Queues

- For each of the following operations on a Stack, Queue, or Deque know the complexity class:
  * push / offer
  * pop / poll
  * peek

- Know the issues for different implementation types: Array, List, or Wrapper based
- Know the properties of each type of ADT such that if given a problem statement you would know which type to use.
