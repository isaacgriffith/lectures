# Project Timelines

## Research Papers

Each of you will be working on one or more research papers throughout the summer.
These writing endeavors have the following timeline (assuming a 20 hour work schedule)

## Writing the Proposal

The proposal is the first portion of the paper. It consists of basically the entire paper
except for the results and discussion (analysis) section. It typically also includes a
timeline in the conclusion section rather than a "important results" section of the conclusion.

## Writing the paper

### Paper Outline

#### Experimental Work

* Title - <title> + "-- A controlled experiment"; Is it informative and does it include the major treatments and the dependent variables?
* Structured Abstract
  - Background - Why is this research important?
  - Objective - What is the question addressed with this research?
  - Methods - What is the statistical context and methods applied?
  - Results - What are the main findings? Practical implications?
  - Limitations - What are the weaknesses of this research?
  - Conclusions - What is the conclusion?
* Keywords - Areas of research the treatments, dependent variables, and study type
* Introduction
  - Problem Statement - What is the problem? Where does it occur? Who has observed it? Why is it important to be solved?
  - Research Objective - What is the research question to be answered by this study? E.g., by using the GQM goal template.
  - Context - What information is necessary to understand whether the research relates to a specific situation (environment)?
  - Paper Organization - How is the rest of the paper organized?
* Background
  - Technology under investigation - What is necessary for a reader to know about the technology to reproduce its application?
  - Alternative technologies - How does this research relate to alternative technologies? What is the control treatment?
  - Related studies - How this research relates to existing research (studies)? What were the results from these studies?
  - Relevance to practice (contributions) - How does it relate to state of the practice?
* Experimental Planning
  - Goals - Formalization of goals, refine the important constructs (e.g., the quality focus) of the experiment's goal
  - Experimental Units - From which population will the sample be drawn? How will the groups be formed (assignment to treatments)? Any kind of randomization and blinding has to be described
  - Experimental Material - Which objects are selected and why?
  - Tasks - Which tasks have to be performed by the subjects?
  - Hypotheses, parameters and variables - What are the constructs and their operationalization? They have to be traceable derived from the research question respectively the goal of the experiment
  - Design - What type of experimental design has been chosen?
  - Procedure - How will the experiment (i.e., data collection) be performed? What instruments, materials, tools will be used and how?
  - Analysis procedures - How will the data be analyzed?
* Execution
  - Preparation - What has been done to prepare the execution of the experiment (i.e., schedule, training)
  - Deviations - Describe any deviations from the plan, e.g., how was the data collection actually performed?
* Analysis
  - Descriptive statistics - What are the results from descriptive statistics?
  - Data set preparation - What was done to prepare the data set, why, and how?
  - Hypothesis testing - How was the data evaluated and was the analysis model validated?
* Discussion
  - Evaluation of results and implications - Explain the results and the relation of the results to earlier research, especially those mentioned in the Background section
  - Threats to validity - How is validity of the experimental results assured? How was the data actually validated? Threats that might have an impact on the validity of the results such as (threats to internal validity), and, furthermore, on the extent to which the hypothesis captures the objectives and the generalizability of the findings (threats to external validty) have to be discussed
  - Inferences - Inferences drawn from the data to more general conditions
  - Lessons learned - Which experience was collected during the course of the experiment
* Conclusions and Future Work
  - Summary - The purpose of this section is to provide a concise summary of the research and its results as presented in the former sections
  - Impact - Description of impacts with regard to cost, schedule, and quality, circumstances under which the approach presumably will not yield the expected benefit
  - Future Work - What other experiments could be run to further investigate the results yielded or evolve the Body of Knowledge
