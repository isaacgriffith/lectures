# Learning Environment {-}

We are all committed to maintaining an inoffensive, non-threatening learning environment for every student. Class members (including the instructor) are thus to treat each other politely--both in word and deed. Offensive humor and aggressive personal advances are specifically forbidden. If you feel uncomfortable with a personal interaction in class, see your instructor for help in solving the problem.
