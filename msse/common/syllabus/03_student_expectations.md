# Student Expectations {-}

The above objectives cannot be met unless you, the student, take an active role in your education. Thus you are expected to:

* **Attend class** on a regular basis and devote your attention to the material presented
* Prepare for each and every class by **reading** the assigned material and completing both **pre- and post-lecture assignments**
* Devote the necessary **time** to preparing assignments and turning them in on time.
    * **Computer Science** is time-intensive
    * You should be prepared to give the time need for each assignment
    * As the class progresses the time required for assignments will increase, be prepared.
* **Time Management** is a requirement. Do not procrastinate, as the amount of time required for any given assignment and any given student cannot be estimated. For this reason you are encourage to begin assignments at the earliest possible date so that you will be able to complete them on time.

This is a 3 credit, as a student, you should expect to put forth on average 6 -- 9 hours of additional effort outside the classroom towards this course. Given that, I expect to utilize this completely.

# Valid Excuses {-}

This course requires that you attend class and participate in classroom activities (including exams). The student handbook notes the following can be considered viable excuses for class absence, in consultation with your instructor:

* Serious Illness
* Severe Weather
* Religious Holidays
* Approved University Activities (e.g., extracurricular athletics, performance groups, student government)
* Emergency Family Issues

Invalid excuses include anything else, but I will specifically note the following:

* Minor Illness
* Typical Winter Weather Conditions
* Work
* Non-emergency Family Issues
* You or your family Purchased Plane Tickets (non-refundable)
