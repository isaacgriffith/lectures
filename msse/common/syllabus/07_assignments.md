# Assignments {-}

Homework assignments are due as assigned on Moodle. Do the homework, it helps. Late homework will be accepted up to the last day of the course, but each day after the due date will incur a linearly increasing penalty. This penalty will result in a 0 grade at midnight of the last day of class.

This course is based upon four components:

* Attendance at lectures and participation during in class exercises.
* Reading assignments
* Project
* Exams
