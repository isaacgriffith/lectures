# Part 01 - Haskell Programming

Complete the following Exercises from DMUC Chapter 1:

* Exercise 16
* Exercise 22
* Exercise 23
* Exercise 25
* Exercise 27

# Part 02 - Equational Reasoning

* Using equational reasoning and your implementation for Exercise 16, prove the following:
    1.) bitwiseAnd [0,0,0] [1,1,0] => [0,0,0]
    2.) bitwiseAnd [1,0,0,1,1] [1,1,1,1] => [1,0,0,1]
* Using equational reasoning and your implementation for Exercise 25, prove the following:
    1.) Input string: "aabbaabbccddaabb", Letter to remove: 'a'
        yields the following string: "bbbbccddbb"
    2.) Input string: "AAAAAAAAA", Letter to remove: 'b'
        yields the following string: "AAAAAAAAA"
    3.) Input string: "", Letter to remove: 'a'
        yields the following string: ""
* Using equational reasoning and your implementation for Exercise 27, prove the following:
    1.) maybeLast [1,1,1,0,0,0,2] => Just 2
    2.) maybeLast [] => Nothing
